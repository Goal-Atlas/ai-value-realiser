30 minutes to develop complete marketing campaigns from concept to broadcast-ready, compliant content
80% AI-powered platform with 20% strategic human oversight for quality assurance
Three master AI agents deployed for business strategy, omnichannel planning, and content creation
EVERSANA, a full-service commercialization company serving pharmaceutical and life sciences organizations, transformed traditional pharma marketing workflows by building the industry's first AI-powered marketing agency on Google Cloud.
Pharmaceutical marketing is notoriously complex, requiring a balance between maintaining regulatory compliance and reaching both patients and prescribers. EVERSANA transforms this process with its end-to-end, AI-powered marketing agency platform built on Google Cloud. Previously, pharma marketing campaigns took weeks or months to develop, with traditional agencies executing tasks sequentially. Now, EVERSANA's specialized AI agents work simultaneously across business strategy, omnichannel planning, and content creation, integrating medical, legal, and regulatory compliance from day one. In just 30 minutes, pharma marketing teams can use EVERSANA's AI Agency platform to iterate from concept to approval-ready video ads, social media content, and compliant marketing materials.
EVERSANA chose Google Cloud for its specialized agentic AI technology rather than basic large language models, which enable the team to build discrete, highly trained agents that function as expert teams. The collaboration ensured data privacy by keeping all client information within a secure corporate infrastructure and never using it for training or advertising. This deep integration allowed EVERSANA to create what it calls the industry's first "AI Agency" platform, fundamentally reimagining pharmaceutical marketing from the ground up. The platform is currently 80% AI-powered and maintains 20% human oversight to ensure quality and precision.
EVERSANA is a leading independent provider of global services to the life sciences industry. The company’s integrated solutions are rooted in the patient experience and span all stages of the product life cycle to deliver long-term, sustainable value for patients, prescribers, channel partners, and payers.
