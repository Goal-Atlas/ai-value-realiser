Crediclub Raises US$80 Million to Boost Mexico’s Operations
Mexican financial institution Crediclub has raised over US$80 million to accelerate its digital transformation. The funding round, led by L Catterton with participation from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other investors, significantly strengthens the company’s capital position.
The investment boosted Crediclub’s capitalization level to an impressive 515%, well above the regulatory minimum of 131%, according to CEO Juan Francisco Fernández. “This level of capitalization demonstrates strong financial stability. For our customers, it ensures the security of their investments,” Fernández said. “It is a key indicator for regulators and rating agencies, showcasing unprecedented financial strength.”
Crediclub, which has achieved a 40% annual growth rate, recently transitioned from a branch-based model to a fully digital platform, closing all 182 branches as part of this transformation, according to the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV).
The company’s digitalization strategy reflects its focus on operational sustainability rather than competing aggressively through savings rates, a common practice among peers. “Our goal is to remain profitable while growing our customer base and meeting their financial needs comprehensively, from savings to credit solutions,” Fernández noted.
As of September 2024, Crediclub reported 1.6 million customers, ranking as the fifth-largest institution in its sector, with total assets of MX$5.1 million.
