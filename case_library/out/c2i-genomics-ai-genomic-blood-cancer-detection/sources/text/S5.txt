Today in cancer diagnostics, a major obstacle facing diagnostic labs and regulators is the lack of standardized reference samples for labs to use for the analytical validation of their whole-genome assays. Especially in the complex field of oncology, there is a heightened need for advanced technology to help execute better treatment decisions, and ultimately, to save more lives.
Under the collaboration, C2i will use its artificial intelligence (AI) to identify a very large set of variants across the entire genome known to be associated with cancer signatures. Twist will then synthesize each of these variants, tuning them up or down to allow for similarity to natural samples, to create a whole-genome sequencing-focused set of reference materials. The reference standard kits will be available through
“There is a tremendous need to have a consistent reference standard for the detection of cancer and minimal residual disease,” said Emily M. Leproust, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of
The reference standards will also be used as training samples, tuning C2i's algorithm for patient sample analysis. Using whole-genome sequencing and machine learning, C2i has developed a way to use (AI) to enable highly precise cancer detection in even the tiniest tumors. The development of this strategic collaboration demonstrates C2i’s investment in furthering the utility and accessibility to whole-genome cancer diagnostics in labs all over the world.
“C2i is committed to increasing the accessibility of whole-genome cancer detection and monitoring to support researchers and clinicians in improving oncology care for patients. We’re proud to work closely with Twist, as these new reference kits will solve an urgent unmet need for lab validation and proficiency testing materials in the cancer diagnosis space,” said Asaf Zviran, CEO and Co-Founder at C2i Genomics.
C2i’s partnership with Twist comes after a year of significant momentum. C2i announced several key partnerships within the last year. The first being the initiation of its global commercial launch through its partnership with NovogeneAIT Genomics. This was followed by a network expansion with Premier Inc., a collaboration with NuProbe Global, and most recently an expansion into
