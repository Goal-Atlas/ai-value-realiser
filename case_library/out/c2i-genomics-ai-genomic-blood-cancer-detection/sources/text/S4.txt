C2i Genomics and the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov) entered into a strategic collaboration to provide precision oncology clinical testing using C2inform, C2i Genomics’s whole genome minimal residual disease test to improve cancer detection and monitoring nationwide.
C2inform uses whole genome sequencing to identify cancer-related mutations by employing AI-driven pattern recognition to detect traces of cancer in patient blood samples at earlier stages compared to currently available technologies.
Through the partnership, C2i Genomics’s and its whole-genome-based assay will be integrated into a nationwide healthcare system for the first time. With Ichilov Hospital Labs serving as the reference lab for cancer hospitals across Israel, C2inform tests will become accessible to the entire population of Israel, accounting for nearly 10 million people.
Through this collaboration, sequencing with WGS of circulating tumor DNA and matched tumors of cancer patients will be performed by Ichilov’s Pathology Institute.
Afterward, sequencing raw data will be uploaded to C2 Genomics’s cloud platform for processing and clinical interpretation. Ichilov Hospital will commercialize and offer the service to its patients while simultaneously enabling other hospitals and pharma companies in Israel to have access to the service.
