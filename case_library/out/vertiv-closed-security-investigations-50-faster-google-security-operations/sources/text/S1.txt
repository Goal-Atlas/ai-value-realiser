27 top security announcements at Next ‘25
By Peter Bailey, VP/GM SecOps, Google Cloud Security
We just wrapped our annual Google Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas, where we introduced innovations across AI, app development, infrastructure, data cloud, partners, and more — including security.
From the moment the curtain went up at our opening keynote, we showcased 229 new products, new capabilities, and new enhancements that highlight Google Cloud’s commitment to how our AI-optimized platform can help transform the way that companies work and our skyrocketing customer momentum.
You can check out a recap of the opening keynote here. We made significant announcements with our seventh-generation TPU, Ironwood, our largest and most powerful TPU to date; three significant new AI inference enhancements; the preview availability of Gemini 2.5 Pro; bringing Gemini to on-premises environments with Google Distributed Cloud; new capabilities to build and manage multi-agent systems; new and improved scientific research tools; and improvements throughout Google Workspace, AI hypercomputer stack, networking, and application development.
Google Unified Security brings together our visibility, threat detection, AI powered security operations, continuous virtual red-teaming, the most trusted enterprise browser, and Mandiant expertise — in one converged security solution running on a planet-scale data fabric.
(Be sure to check out the reimagining of the Wizard of Oz at The Sphere, a collaboration between Sphere Entertainment, Google DeepMind, Google Cloud, Hollywood production company Magnopus, and five others.)
For the first time this year, we also hosted CISO Connect at Next, a unique opportunity for security and business leaders to delve into the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape with experts from Google on the current threat landscape, breach mitigation strategies, and the transformative potential of AI in fortifying your organization's security posture.
"We are all solving for the same security challenges; CISO Connect offers a safe environment to collaborate and share, unlike any other conference," said Mike Orosz, CISO, Vertiv.
We also focused heavily on innovations across our security portfolio, designed to deliver stronger security outcomes and enable every organization to make Google a part of their security team. Fresh from Next ‘25, here’s our top 27 security announcements.
