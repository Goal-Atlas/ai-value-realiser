50+ events hosted in 2021 using Live Production.
Latin America’s largest media company, Globo, comprises the former TV Globo, Globosat, Globo.com, and DGCORP (Corporate Management). Besides broadcast TV channels, the organization has 26 pay-TV channels, Globoplay, offering video on-demand and streaming, and news and digital content portals for journalism, sports, and general news. With its extensive network of affiliate partners covering all of Brazil and its penetration in Brazilian communities in other countries, Globo has local, regional, national, and international reach at the same time.
The company has been engaged in transforming into a mediatech since 2018, using tech as a foundation and focusing on building a direct relationship with consumers. After setting goals like optimizing its infrastructure and generating business opportunities through a scalable platform, Globo ran tests, developed products, and assessed service providers that could keep up with its ambitions.
"In 2018, we also started our first initiative of rendering visual effects in the cloud. These first steps provided further proof that we were on the right track and that our journey was just beginning," says Thiago Abreu, Globo's Media Solutions Manager.
"In 2019, we mapped the main stages of the audiovisual media value chain that had already emerged as feasible transformers for the model. We built a high-level architecture and began developing initiatives with major industry partners, such as Playout, media services, Editing, AI/ML for data recommendations and enriching, and Live Production," adds Abreu.
In early 2021, the company began using Google Cloud's services. The goal is for Google Cloud to be its main cloud solution provider, as well as an innovation catalyst for the communications firm. According to planning, relevant stages of Globo's content production and distribution will be migrated to the cloud, paving the way for subsequent changes.
The efficiency and quality this transformation is projected to bring will directly impact deliveries to Globo's audience, data management improvement and the creation of business models. In the short term, digital evolution projects that were already part of the company's work routine have been enhanced based on their usage time and the new possibilities enabled by Google Cloud's solutions.
Going live with Cloud Live Production
One example of these changes can be seen in the channel's large-scale productions, both live and recorded. Considering Globo's high number of annual productions (it hosts over 3,500 sports events and has approximately 200 hours of own content, distributed over more than 40 broadcast, pay-TV, and over-the-top (OTT) channels), its infrastructure requires organization and logistics to cater to multiple requests from production controls and mobile units.
There are geographical limitations for events hosted throughout Brazil, which are also affected by seasonality. Therefore, Globo needs a dedicated team to handle all of that, a fixed physical location, and a nimble structure to make projects happen - and those are just a few of the factors impacting logistics and final costs.
Other variables include the video switcher environment, integrating systems to broadcast audio and video signals, acquiring capture and processing gear, and depending on static structures. This led to the concept of Live Production, given the need to reassess how productions are made.
"The urgent need to modify that working model led us to adopt Cloud Live Production, as we began using virtualized systems in a public cloud so that people could access and operate the platform anywhere. Synergy, convenience, and scalability were the most valuable traits we observed."
—Wilson Oliveira de Almeida, Media Solutions Manager, GloboThe cloud as an alternative
The Live Production project was already underway, as it had begun before Globo chose Google Cloud. First, the company ran simulations with the platforms. Then, specific events were held live to help consolidate the use of the infrastructure and the apps available in the environment. When the partnership came into play, the project started using Compute Engine, Cloud Storage and Cloud Interconnect.
Completed event broadcasts are sent through Cloud Interconnect's facilities. After the broadcasting station receives them, broadcasts go live on Globo's various multiplatforms, or are sent from the cloud to the content delivery network (CDN) infrastructure.
"Producing content in the cloud gives us more agility, scalability, and capacity as we need less time to begin a new journey with intervention from our content areas. The time needed between sketching out a production and completing it has been reduced thanks to the scalability of cloud solutions and services, which allows us to increase capacity for specific situations, or permanently," confirms Laercio Silveira, Globo's Production Platform Manager.
Under the traditional standard, Globo employed human resources from a single location to hold events, concentrating its entire operation in a single branch. On the other hand, when performing activities that use the cloud, the company can add several collaborators and decentralize operations.
In the past, temporary services had to be hired to complete jobs successfully, but now Globo realizes permanent services are important, especially to understand production dynamics and process development.
"With the new model, operation environments in the broadcasting station are slimmed down, contributions can be made from anywhere and operations are decentralized. We will also see cost savings, as investments in traditional gear and its associated costs will decrease in the mid and long term and we undergo the transition towards leasing cloud microservices, which we can use more or less as required," says Silveira.
"We have more freedom to create. A major benefit is working with scalability and elasticity. Many productions, such as the World Cup, the Olympics, and Big Brother, are seasonal events. This opens a huge potential for increasing efficiency, while leaving no resources idle."
—Bruno Lopes, Media Solutions Manager, GloboParadigm shifts and early positive points
In the past, Globo's on-premise production controls, which often had schedule constraints, determined which shows would be produced, whereas deploying Google Cloud's platform means TV sports, news, and entertainment teams' demands can be met.
"We have virtual machines that began supporting us at almost the same time as Live Production, i.e., specific machines were developed to run apps. And Cloud Interconnect has made all the difference regarding latency, which is almost imperceptible," says Hélio Eufrauzino, Globo’s Media Solutions Specialist.
Globo's round trip time (RTT) is just 10 milliseconds, allowing it to assess latency. Elastic, agile, and scalable computing is another highlight in the early phase of this true digital transformation.
"A test that surprised us all was a volleyball match we covered. We were broadcasting the game live on TV and thought it would end in an hour and a half. However, as the game progressed, we spent longer live and realized the cloud platform can stay live for three hours or longer. This allowed us to assess performance and we were satisfied. We're still looking at what can be improved," says Eufrauzino.
"In 2021, the launch year, we hosted 55 events. We've already hosted 33 in 2022 and are aiming for 200, with two held simultaneously. However, to meet our on-prem asset optimization goals, we plan to host 1,200 events per year on the cloud with up to four held simultaneously by 2027," explains Gabriel Fraga, Globo's Media Solutions Agilist.
Another Live Production highlight was how it was perceived by the team of employees, communication professionals, and people directly involved in events. Simplification, the most clearly noticeable advantage for events of live production, was a positive surprise even for sports commentators.
"If I had to describe the cloud experience in one word, it would be 'innovation.' I was stunned by the resources - it really looked like we were filming everything in a studio. Quality didn't drop, the image was clean. Taking part in such an innovative experience was a pleasure," says Bruno Souza, Sports Commentator at Globo.
Physical Clapperboard and a strategy supported by Google Video Intelligence
Another example of what's being done to overcome technical challenges is changes with the clapperboards, a key element to schedule and automate the production of shows, soap operas, and series.
A clapperboard is a device used in audiovisual productions to identify shots and takes filmed during a production. People working in Globo's studios would follow a content archiving process that used memory cards, which were ingested by an app. That app would extract file metadata, but the metadata contained in the clapperboards had to be inserted into the system manually.
An operator would open each video file, find the clapperboard, and manually type in the information in a form provided by the app. Only after consolidating these metadata was the recorded material inserted in the post-production system.
Adopting Video AI streamlined this procedure and changed how Globo worked. Although the app still receives video files from the camera's memory card, it now creates a brief, lower-resolution proxy video lasting a few seconds, with just the initial moment when the clapperboard is shown.
That proxy video is then sent to a space in Cloud Storage. After the upload is complete, Cloud Functions applies Video AI's optical character recognition (OCR) service to the proxy and formats the results, which are sent back to the app. A web clapperboard-creation app was created and hosted in App Engine to standardize information, a process complemented by Firebase.
"Our goal was standardizing. We have a web app that can open and run smoothly on cell phones, where we use App Engine and the entire configuration of specific logins, which are stored in Firebase," says Pedro Gil Oliveira de Magalhães Couto, Developer at Globo.
App performance and enhanced security
The app is being gradually incorporated into different Globo productions, for both external and in-studio shows. This entails a large volume of content, which grows as efficiency gains are confirmed.
Cloud tools have improved performance and freed employees from a repetitive, labor-intensive process, leaving more time for them to perform more critical tasks.
Security is another major concern for Globo's teams. They could not send video content to the cloud without displaying it before, so they had to get creative to find a workaround.
"Rather than uploading videos to the cloud, the app selects them and just sends frames (pictures) containing the clapperboard. AI analytics use those frames instead of videos. We also decided not to maintain a cloud infrastructure. The AI service is consumed through an API, and Internet access is open exclusively for that API, mitigating security risks," explains Luis Henrique da Rocha Santos, Globo's Media Solutions Manager.
Digital Clapperboard: Data automation
At the other end of this process - post-production - the company had to deal with another operational bottleneck. The digital clapperboard data used to identify content during displays also had to be inserted manually in the media management system. Operators would do this by opening the media in the display system, finding the clapperboard, and copying the data in the system.
"When the operator received the material, they had to open the file, find the clapperboard, and write down the show's name, scene, director, start/end time, and additional details. Everything was done manually, including the media ingestion process, and you needed someone to check the material had arrived," explains Luis Henrique.
Conversations with Globo's display teams led to the idea of testing various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) providers to find a solution to streamline that operation. Vision AI proved the best-suited tool to meet the team's demands.
In the first half of 2020, Globo built a proof of concept based on detection levels from the clapperboard frames. Since then, the company has been working on the integrations needed to extract all the metadata used in flow automation.
Usability and benefits
The main tools used to operate the digital clapperboard are Vision AI and Cloud Storage, which stores the XML templates and generates visual logs for audits, for example. These tools follow a basic order: after reaching a specific folder, materials are processed by an app in Python, which detects the clapperboard's entry point and the active video's entry and exit point. It then extracts a frame featuring the clapperboard and turns it into an image.
That image is sent through an API call to Vision AI. The detected image is inserted along with data from the active video on an XML template downloaded from Cloud Storage. The file is then sent to the display system, which incorporates the metadata and the media.
"After our first impressions of the solution's usability, the advantages we noticed included time savings for operators, shorter processing times, and increased assertiveness of markings."
—Luis Henrique da Rocha Santos, Media Solutions Manager, GloboWhat the future holds
By developing apps and deploying useful tools for physical and digital clapperboards, Globo expects to set more goals, support its decision-making through surveys and tests, and continue its innovation journey to remain at the technological forefront of its industry and solidify its benchmark role.
As for Live Production, since Compute Engine's resources are available to employees wherever they are, a differentiator is an improved use of human resources in Globo's multiple offices, both in Brazil and in other countries. Furthemore, the company will gradually eliminate the need for resources at venues, such as mobile production units, and at broadcasting stations, such as event production controls.
Globo's digital transformation journey, which began with early testing in 2018 and was expanded by its partnership with Google Cloud in 2021, is a constant innovation process. Using AI, ML, and data analytics technologies, new products and services are developed and added to media production and distribution processes. These projects modernize operations and securely and reliably accelerate the company's path toward becoming a mediatech firm. The partnerships' ongoing work is also seen in the increasing quality of the products and services Globo delivers to its audience and in the planned creation of new business models in the near future.
