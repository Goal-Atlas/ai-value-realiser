The Globo Group, which includes companies like Editora Globo, Sistema Globo de Rádio, Globo Ventures, and the maintainer of Fundação Roberto Marinho, recently underwent a comprehensive reorganization of its business areas. This transformation aimed to provide high-quality experiences through content and services across its platforms.
The core strategy revolved around placing the customer at the center of the business and leveraging the synergy between traditional television and digital opportunities. The “One Globo” movement, initiated in September 2018 and launched in January 2020, encompassed the planning phase of this endeavor.
According to Eduardo Amaral, the AdTech Senior Manager at Globo, the overarching goal of this process is to make the conglomerate a 100% media tech entity, enabling scalability in a world where content and technology seamlessly merge. This transformation has significant implications for the business models of media companies and big tech firms alike.
The Challenge: Globo’s Journey to Become a 100% Media Tech Conglomerate
Transitioning into the digital realm poses significant challenges for companies, particularly in transforming mindset and culture. Globo Group recognized this and embarked on an ambitious goal of becoming a fully-fledged media tech entity within three years.
To achieve this, Globo developed tools for major advertisers on its Globo Ads platforms and introduced Globo SIM, an initiative to involve small advertisers in the advertising ecosystem. These groundbreaking projects can potentially disrupt traditional advertising practices in Latin America, fostering innovation.
Globo’s initiatives aim to revolutionize the traditional model of delivering advertisements to open TV, which historically relied solely on file sharing without technological involvement or consumer interaction. By leveraging technology, Globo provides advertisers with enhanced capabilities and engagement opportunities, bridging the gap between traditional and digital platforms.
Through digital transformation and innovative solutions, Globo demonstrates its commitment to reshaping the industry by embracing media tech. The goal is to enhance its position as a leading media conglomerate in Latin America, catering to the evolving needs of major and small advertisers.
The Solution: Empowering Advertisers through Automation
Globo partnered with Globant to streamline advertising processes, whose advanced cloud data intelligence facilitated a seamless journey for advertisers. Through Globo Ads, advertisers could purchase slots, create and track ads, and access vital campaign performance insights, such as impact levels, demographics, and social media engagement. Globant employed statistical modeling techniques based on AI and ML, empowering Globo Ads to deliver targeted and effective campaigns.
Globant also played a crucial role in Globo’s innovative Globo SIM project. This new model simplified the sale of commercial spaces to small advertisers, eliminating the need for agencies or prior advertising experience. Advertisers could choose values and simulate ads via the Globo SIM website, reducing costs and granting greater autonomy. Globant’s commitment and integration ensured a cohesive user experience, unifying data, and interactions across the Globo ecosystem.
The Results: Globo and Globant Reshaped Advertising Landscape
Globo Ads and Globo SIM have garnered praise from advertisers, providing them with comprehensive campaign tracking and increasing conversion rates. Eduardo emphasizes Globo’s commitment to customer-centricity and the fantastic results achieved through these platforms, contributing significantly to their revenue. Globo SIM represents their new endeavor to expand reach and engagement.
The automation of these platforms has also led to significant cost reductions. Globo recognizes Globant for surpassing industry standards, showcasing attributes like consultative expertise, round-the-clock availability, streamlined processes, organization, problem-solving accuracy, and a cost-effective approach aligned with market practices. Globant’s delivery agility has facilitated quick decision-making, fostering a strong and trusted partnership with Globo.
The collaboration between Globo Group and Globant has yielded excellent results, driving significant digital transformations within Brazil’s largest communication group. The partnership not only delivers proven expertise but also provides an array of additional benefits, demonstrating Globant’s commitment to going beyond the basics. As both companies continue their journey, they anticipate further advancements across other platforms, building on the success achieved thus far.
