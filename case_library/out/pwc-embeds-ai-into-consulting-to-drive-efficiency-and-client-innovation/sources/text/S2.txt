Summary: PwC UK’s 2025 results highlight a sector under pressure but also adapting. Profitability has been protected through cost control, while AI is being embedded into delivery at scale. The consulting cycle has turned, but growth opportunities remain for firms that reset their models.

PwC Opens Reporting Season for the Big Four
PwC UK’s annual results set the tone for the Big Four – and by extension, the consulting industry.
The headline numbers are clear:
→ Revenue growth slowed to 0.4%, down from 9–16% in the previous three years
→ Headcount fell by more than 2,000
→ Consulting and risk advisory both contracted
→ The Middle East, once PwC’s growth engine, delivered almost no growth after Saudi projects faltered and the Public Investment Fund ban took hold
On the surface, this looks like a sector losing momentum. Look deeper, and it shows how professional services firms are repositioning for the next cycle.

Margins Protected, Growth Delayed
PwC’s overall profit rose 20% to £1.37b, a 20% profit margin, despite stagnant top-line growth.
How? By pulling cost levers: fewer staff, slower promotions, tighter spend. Protecting profitability this way shows resilience, but it also underlines fragility. Profit buys time, but it does not create new growth engines.
Across the industry, this pivot from volume to margin is reshaping career paths, promotion tracks, and hiring strategies. For consultants, the partner ladder is narrowing. For firms, it’s a temporary fix that must be matched with new delivery models.

AI Is Now Built Into the Business Model
AI is no longer a press release. At PwC, it’s now an org chart decision. The firm created a standalone technology and AI unit, reorganising service lines to reflect digital delivery.
This matters for two reasons:
→ Scale of investment. PwC can commit resources to AI at a scale most mid-tier and boutique firms cannot
→ Shift in delivery model. Centralised engineering teams and productised services signal a move away from bespoke slideware towards reusable, tech-enabled solutions
This is the real competitive divide emerging in consulting: firms that can embed AI fluency across delivery, and firms that can’t.

The UK Consulting Cycle
The UK consulting market contracted in 2024 (Source Global Research estimates a 3–4% fall) but is forecast to recover in 2025, with growth expected between 5–7%.
This is cyclical, not structural decline. Demand has not disappeared, but it has shifted. Executives are still spending, but on compliance, transactions, and working AI that delivers outcomes, not experiments.
For firms, this means shorter project scopes, outcome-linked pricing, and tougher scrutiny on delivery teams.
⸻
A Sector-Wide Reset
PwC’s slowdown is not unique. Deloitte has trimmed partner promotions and tightened bonuses. EY and KPMG have slowed hiring and reduced pay rises. Across the Big Four and beyond, cost discipline is replacing pandemic-era expansion.
For firms overweight in the Gulf, PwC’s exposure is a cautionary tale. Mega-projects are high reward, but fragile. When they stall, so does growth. Diversification of pipelines and geographies is no longer optional – it’s survival.

The Risk of Hiring From a Client
PwC’s slowdown in Saudi Arabia wasn’t only about stalled projects. It also clashed with the Public Investment Fund after trying to hire Neom’s chief internal audit officer. The dispute led to a one-year ban on bidding for new PIF advisory work – a major setback given how central Saudi projects are to PwC’s Middle East revenues.
The episode reported in the Financial Times underlines a wider risk for professional services. Hiring talent directly from a client might strengthen capability, but it can also damage trust and jeopardise future contracts.
In markets like the Gulf, where a handful of mega-projects drive consulting demand, that kind of fallout can quickly hit the bottom line.

Resilience, But At What Cost?
PwC’s Senior Partner Marco Amitrano captured the balance neatly:
“While headwinds remain, improving market sentiment is creating a stronger pipeline across our multidisciplinary portfolio.”
The results show both sides of that coin – resilience achieved through cost control, and decisive bets on AI and restructuring.
Profit buys time. Delivery buys the future.
The firms that strike that balance will be the ones still growing when demand rebounds.
