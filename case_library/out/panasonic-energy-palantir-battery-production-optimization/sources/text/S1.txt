Palantir Technologies is forming a multi-year partnership with Panasonic Energy of North America to add smart tech sensors and AI-driven operational analytics to its EV battery facility in Sparks, Nevada, according to a press release.
The facility, known as Gigafactory 1, is notable for manufacturing and supplying lithium ion-cells to Tesla Motors. Now, both the main factory and PENA’s new facility in De Soto, Kansas, will be run on Palantir’s Foundry product starting in 2025.
The smart factory agreement includes integrating edge sensors across factory lines, introducing AI to automate systems and providing operational data to workers on the facility’s floor.
“We engaged Palantir to assist on our journey towards a connected factory by addressing the challenges of disparate data systems and manual [work-arounds] leading to inaccurate data analysis,” said Justin Herman, chief information officer of PENA, in the press release.
Palantir says its Foundry system will enable PENA to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to better understand and manage its facilities data, replacing most of its previous manual processes previously. PENA expects the partnership to quickly generate cost savings and reduce manufacturing waste.
This partnership comes a day after Palantir’s launch of its “Palantir Foundry for Manufacturing on Amazon Web Services,” an integrated offering that merges industrial data with AI decision-making and operational tools. Also earlier this week, the software company was awarded a $463 million contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command.
Following the latest deal for Palantir, MarketWatch reported shares of the Peter Thiel-founded big data company reached a 17-month high, more than double the price since May 4 and following eight straight quarters of flat to decelerating growth.
The company is notable for providing its analytics services to a number of high-profile government agencies, and now adds a high-profile electric battery manufacturer to its list of clients during a period of rapid scaling for the EV space.
