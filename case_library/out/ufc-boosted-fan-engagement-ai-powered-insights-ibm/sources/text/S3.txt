The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion has struck a deal centered around artificial intelligence (AI) with global technology giant IBM.
Through a tie-up unveiled today, IBM becomes UFC's global AI partner – the first time the MMA promotion has put a brand into this particular designation.

The deal involves the creation of an insights engine built by IBM’s data and AI platform, watsonx. That engine will aim to “provide the UFC global viewing audience with more timely, in-depth information,” which will update in real-time on-screen during UFC broadcasts, as the data is continually generated.
The UFC Insights Engine built with IBM watsonx is set to launch in early 2025, and is being designed in collaboration with the UFC research and development team.
The insights, graphics, and statistics – which will be IBM-branded – will be integrated into platforms such as pre-event programming, pay-per-view broadcasts, social media channels, and also in-venue video screens.
Essentially, this will provide more data and – UFC hopes – a richer viewing experience for every fan tuning into live or on-demand UFC content.

By GlobalDataThe trend of providing data and statistics as an accompaniment and sidebar to on-screen action is something that has been gathering pace amongst major sports properties over the last few years.
Grant Norris-Jones, head of global partnerships at UFC’s parent company TKO, said: “IBM is an iconic blue-chip, global brand with decades of experience in sports marketing. Together, we’re pioneering a product to revolutionize analytics and information in live sports. This partnership marks a pivotal win, not only for UFC and IBM, but also for fans around the world.”
Late last month, UFC disclosed a global marketing deal with streaming platform Kick. Through this agreement, a dedicated UFC channel will be created on Kick (which was launched in 2022), featuring original content such as fight watchalongs, press conferences, athlete interviews, and behind-the-scenes access.
Jonathan Adashek, IBM’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, added: “Data and AI solutions like UFC Insights Engine built with IBM watsonx can offer current fans entirely new ways to connect with their favorite athletes and sports, while also building excitement among new generations of MMA fans.”
Earlier this month, IBM and Formula 1 motor racing heavyweights Ferrari announced a multi-year premium partnership, effective from January 1.
The new partnership aims to use IBM’s expertise and tools to work on Ferrari’s digital and on-track fan experiences and engagement as the team’s premium partner in IT consulting.
