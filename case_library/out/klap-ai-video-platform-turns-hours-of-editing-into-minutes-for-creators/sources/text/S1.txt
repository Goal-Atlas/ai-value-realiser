The AI video platform Klap, powered by Google Cloud, turns hours of editing into minutes for two million creators worldwide.
Vertical short-form video now dominates social media feeds,but manually editing long-form content for these formats is tedious and time-consuming. Zigg co-founders, president Théo Champion and general manager Victor Timsit, set out to address this challenge with Klap, an AI-powered platform that generates shareable clips from existing content in minutes.
“A few years ago, as repurposed short form content became more and more widespread, increasingly powerful large language models and advanced transcription tools started to emerge. We realized we could use them to automate the most tedious aspects of the editing process,” explains Champion, President and Co-founder of Zigg. Users upload their content to Klap’s web interface, where AI models use the audio to detect engaging “short-worthy” moments and automatically reframe footage from landscape to portrait. Within 10 minutes, they receive a gallery of short, vertical videos ready to download, publish, or fine-tune in the platform’s built-in editor.
Launched in 2023, Klap has since attracted more than two million users worldwide. With that growth came technical challenges. “Video transcoding is extremely compute-intensive,” says Champion. “And as we grew, our infrastructure costs grew even faster.” The team needed a platform that could handle petabytes of video data, keep costs predictable, and give its two-person team — Champion manages the backend and infrastructure, while Timsit handles the frontend and design — full control of their stack. To do this, they consolidated Klap’s infrastructure on Google Cloud.
“Google Cloud just works, and it keeps working,” says Champion. “We’re a small team, and having an infrastructure we can trust lets us focus entirely on the product.”
Initially, the platform was a simple Python instance running on Cloud Run, with no user interface. “Users would submit a video, we’d process everything on that single server, and then send it back via email,” recalls Champion. The team worked with a range of specialized GPU and transcoding providers, but costs quickly became unsustainable and scaling was cumbersome.
Each new spike in users required manual adjustments and added infrastructure complexity.
The company decided to migrate video processing, storage, and task management into one unified environment. Now, Compute Engine handles the heavy lifting of video transcoding and AI processing, while Cloud Storage stores the platform’s growing library of user videos. Pub/Sub manages the flow of distributed processing tasks, ensuring each job is queued and executed efficiently. “This setup has enabled us to lower costs significantly,” says Champion. “Since consolidating on Google Cloud, our storage and processing costs are a third of what they would have been elsewhere.”
Today, as the company maintains steady 7% month-on-month growth, its architecture automatically scales to meet user demand, while leveraging spot instances to keep compute costs low. “When a TikTok video about us went viral, we suddenly had tens of thousands of new users,” Champion recalls. “Our bill skyrocketed overnight. By moving everything to one large Compute Engine instance, we reduced our costs tenfold instantly. And we did it without changing providers or disrupting service.”
Crucially, the team has observed significant improvements in reliability and uptime. “We’ve worked with several different providers,” he says. “Google Cloud is the only one that’s never given us serious issues. Since moving most of our services to Google, our error rate has steadily gone down.” The result is a more consistent, reliable user experience, with smoother video processing and 99.99% “four nine” uptime as opposed to 99.9 beforehand.
Faster processing, fewer errors, and greater uptime have opened the door to new enterprise contracts, where trust in infrastructure is a key part of the sales process. Zigg is preparing to scale its B2B offering and serve more enterprise clients through its API model. “When clients see we’re built entirely on Google Cloud, it gives them confidence that we’re serious and scalable,” says Champion. “Reliability is key for enterprise users — they require 99.9% uptime. With Google Cloud, we’ve seen huge improvements in that area.”
Looking ahead, Klap is expanding its AI capabilities beyond speech-based editing, exploring multimodal models that understand both audio and visual context and recognize not just what’s said, but what happens on screen. This will demand significant GPU power, large-scale data management, and efficient model training pipelines.“Right now, we’re focused on compute and storage,” says Champion. “But as we train larger models, we’ll explore Vertex AI to handle future workloads.”
“For me, it all comes down to control, cost efficiency, and the kind of reliability that helps me sleep at night,” he concludes. “Google Cloud gives me all three.”
Zigg is the Paris-based AI startup behind Klap.app, a platform that automates video editing to make content sharing faster, smarter, and more accessible for millions of users.
