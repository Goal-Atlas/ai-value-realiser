Wendy's Quality Supply Chain Co-op (QSCC), a purchasing cooperative that serves over 6, 400 Wendy's restaurants in the United States and Canada, has partnered with Palantir Technologies to expedite its digital transformation and AI adoption. According to a press release on August 7th, the collaboration between QSCC and Palantir, an AI systems provider, aims to develop an integrated supply chain network, implement AI-driven automated workflows, and create a connected ecosystem of suppliers, distributors, and restaurants. Pete Suerken, QSCC President and CEO, stated in the release, "Together with Palantir, we're leveraging the power of the supply chain ecosystem to drive new sales and operating efficiencies, giving Wendy's a distinct advantage in the industry. " During the first phase of the digital transformation, QSCC will transition to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), enabling improved decision-making speed and scale by connecting different data sources. In the second phase, QSCC will utilize Palantir AIP for supply chain management and waste prevention. This will result in cost savings and efficiency improvements across the supply chain through the implementation of large language models and other AI systems. Ted Mabrey, head of global commercial at Palantir, highlighted that these changes will benefit Wendy's restaurant operators, suppliers, and distributors. Mabrey expressed excitement about continuing to grow in the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) sector alongside Wendy's, stating, "Our AI operating system powers many of America's leading companies, providing them with a technology-driven competitive advantage. " Wendy's has previously incorporated AI systems into customer-facing applications. In March 2023, the company introduced an AI-based loyalty platform that analyzes customer data to offer personalized rewards and incentives.
The system employs gamification to encourage and acknowledge customer loyalty. Additionally, in May 2023, Wendy's partnered with Google to bring AI to their drive-thrus with the "Wendy's FreshAI" system. This system automates the ordering process, allowing customers to engage in natural conversations, receive quick answers to queries, and be understood, even if their order is not strictly phrased as it appears on menus.
