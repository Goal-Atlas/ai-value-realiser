“Q3 was an exceptional quarter, with standout performances across the board,” said Gina Mastantuono, president and chief financial officer. “Massive platform demand, combined with AI-driven efficiencies, not only fueled results but also reinforced our ability to scale with accelerating margin expansion.”
ServiceNow Q3 FY 2025 Earnings Raise Outlook on AI-Driven Demand
Analyst Take: ServiceNow’s results indicate durable demand for its AI platform and multi-workflow portfolio, with cRPO strength suggesting stable near-term growth. Management highlighted rapid adoption of Now Assist and AI Control Tower, multi-agent workflows in the Zurich release, and growing front-office traction via CPQ and CSM. U.S. Federal delivered above expectations, with OneGov simplifying adoption and pilots converting to production. With multi-product attach across top deals and AI-led operating leverage, the setup into Q4 FY 2025 and FY 2026 appears supported, though management remains cautious about federal deal timing amid government shutdown dynamics.
AI Platform Adoption and Upsell Engines
ServiceNow’s AI portfolio is scaling as a cross-platform upsell driver, with AI products on pace to exceed $0.5 billion in annual contract value (ACV) in FY 2025 and management focused on surpassing a $1 billion ACV target in FY 2026. Now Assist recorded 12 deals over $1 million in net new ACV (NNACV), including one over $10 million, indicating broadening deal sizes and multi-stakeholder adoption. AI Control Tower deal volume quadrupled quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), and AI Agent Assist consumption increased more than 55x since late May, underscoring early usage momentum. The Zurich platform release introduced multi-agent orchestration, governance, and secure integrations intended to accelerate production-scale deployments. With 100+ prepackaged agentic workflows and forward-deployed engineers for co-innovation, the company is positioned to reduce time-to-value. This strengthens the AI upsell motion and creates visibility into continued platform expansion.
Federal Momentum and Platform Standardization
U.S. Federal outperformed NNACV expectations in Q3 FY 2025, with management citing rapid conversion of Now Assist pilots and early interest in AI Control Tower for governance. The GSA OneGov agreement streamlines licensing and adoption paths, supporting upgrades from Standard to Pro Plus and broader platform standardization. Management highlighted an estimated 30% efficiency potential and multi-year savings opportunity for agencies adopting ServiceNow’s AI platform. Renewal rates remain stable at 97% (98% excluding a large federal agency closure), supporting cohort durability and expansion potential. cRPO growth of 20.5% YoY cc and RPO of $24.3 billion provide additional near-term revenue visibility. Federal dynamics should remain constructive, with procurement timing the main variable.
CRM and CPQ as Front-Office On-Ramps
Front-office traction continued, with AI-powered CPQ and CSM driving multi-product deals and targeted displacements. CSM Plus deal volume tripled YoY, and a leading global technology company tripled its CPQ commitment, scaling from a single product/channel to broader rollout. Wins included a hardware manufacturer selecting CPQ and manufacturing solutions to scale sales and service without adding cost, and a European auto OEM standardizing CPQ globally. Management emphasized a unified AI experience across data, workflows, and agents that reframes CRM as a system of action rather than siloed records. Partnerships like Genesys aim to unify contact center, CRM, and service operations with agent-to-agent orchestration to accelerate resolution. The front-office pipeline suggests ongoing contribution to multi-product attach and larger deal sizes.
Guidance and Final Thoughts
Q4 FY 2025 guidance calls for subscription revenue of $3.42–$3.43 billion and cRPO growth of 23% YoY, with non-GAAP operating margin at 30%; FY 2025 guidance raises subscription revenue to $12.84–$12.85 billion (prior: $12.78–$12.80 billion), operating margin to 31%, and free cash flow margin to 34%. Management noted strong public sector demand but incorporated caution for government shutdown timing. ServiceNow’s strong Q3 performance is underpinned by excellent execution, notably a cRPO growth of 20.5% YoY (exceeding guidance by over 200 bps), which is likely being fueled by AI upselling and expansion into new front-office markets—two anticipated long-term growth catalysts.
