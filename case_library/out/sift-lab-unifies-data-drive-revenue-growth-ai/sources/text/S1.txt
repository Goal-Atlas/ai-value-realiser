Powered by Google Cloud, Sift Lab unifies data, accelerates decisions, and drives measurable revenue growth through AI.
For businesses, every interaction with a customer or potential customer creates dozens of data points, from geolocation to purchase intent. In theory, this should enable marketing teams to create campaigns that are more personalized and relevant than ever. In reality, however, potential insights often get lost in disconnected systems and data silos.
“Marketers have a lot of data, and need a way to get actionable insights quickly,” says Linda Hellström, CEO of Sift Lab. The Swedish AI company, born out of academic research at Umeå University’s ICE Lab, set out to address this by building an AI-powered MarTech platform that helps teams turn complex customer data into real-time marketing actions. Through predictive analytics, automated segmentation, Machine Learning, conversational AI, and interoperability across marketing channels, the platform aims to help brands move beyond short-term campaign metrics, better understand their most profitable audiences, and nurture long-term relationships.
“The shift to cloud infrastructure has really accelerated the focus on lifetime value,” says Hellström. “With all customer, product, and campaign data in one environment, it’s much easier to generate insights and activate them across channels.
Companies are realizing they can monetize their first-party data, both in advertising and by creating new business opportunities.” Sift Lab needed a cloud foundation capable of handling enormous data sets at high speed, supporting predictive analytics and integrating with advertising tools used daily by marketers. They turned to Google Cloud.
“Many of our clients already use Google Cloud, so it was natural for us to be part of that ecosystem,” explains Hellström. “It’s easy to work with, deeply connected to marketing tools like Google Ads, and builds real trust with our customers because everything integrates seamlessly.”
Sift Lab’s self-service AI environment combines predictive analytics and insights, segmentation, and the conversational AI agent Sift Sense. Sift Sense uses Vertex AI and Gemini for natural-language understanding, together with proprietary predictive modeling for marketing use cases enabling marketers to query, interpret, and act on insights without data science support or spending hours poring over spreadsheets.
Users log in to a web interface where they can view data insights across business areas, generate or customize segmentations and audiences, and get instant answers to questions such as “Which customers are most likely to repurchase next month?” or “Which products drive the highest lifetime value?”
The company’s proprietary analytics and segmentation database is hosted on Google Cloud. Within this environment, predictive models uncover behavioral patterns, such as churn risk, lifetime value, buying pattern or discount sensitivity, while Gemini helps make those insights accessible.
“For example, we use Gemini to generate names for segments and audiences, which helps companies intuitively understand and work with their data,” explains Hellström. For one client selling wellness products, Sift Lab identified distinct personas: male bodybuilders who regularly purchased protein powder, and female shoppers more interested in vitamins and supplements. “Before that, their communication had been geared entirely toward men,” says Hellström. “The personas helped them understand their female customers and how to target them effectively.” According to one client, predictive segmentation alone has saved them hundreds of hours per year.
The company’s unique clustering technology also helps brands understand how products relate to each other, identifying which items are frequently purchased together or appeal to similar audiences. Marketers can then export predictive audiences, products or customers with any attributes directly to Google Ads and other platforms, with clients reporting up to 50% improvement in return on ad spend (ROAS). “We believe one of the biggest opportunities for enterprise companies going forward lies in their advertising budgets, and being able to connect directly to Google’s marketing ecosystem is a real advantage,” says Hellström.
Retailers using the platform have reported analytics workflows that run up to 10 times faster than before. “For our clients, a significant benefit is time savings in setup and analytics. As one customer put it, “The basket analysis alone would have taken us five months to build, and now it’s out of the box’,” Hellström adds. Customers have also observed significant improvements in click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate, translating into increases in campaign performance of up to 200%.
In addition to campaign-level performance, clients have seen customer lifetime value, a key measure of long-term profitability, rise across projects. An uplift of 15-30% on CLV is documented. Ultimately, these improvements can contribute to an increase in total revenue of 7–15%.
The next step for Sift Lab will be enabling teams to go from analysis to campaign deployment in a single prompt. The company is expanding its use of Gemini and Vertex AI to automate the entire marketing cycle: gathering signals, clustering audiences, generating campaign logic, and exporting results to activation platforms. A multi-agent communication (MCP) server will enable different AI components, such as analytics, segmentation, and campaign setup agents, to share data and coordinate actions in real time. “The goal is to automate the entire workflow so users can simply prompt campaign setups directly through the system,” says Hellström. “Soon, instead of adding rules manually, you’ll simply type a prompt and the system will generate the campaign itself.”
For Hellström, collaboration with Google Cloud has been fundamental to Sift Lab’s growth and future direction. Early support from Google helped the company accelerate development and scale its technology, and the team is looking forward to the next steps. “We’ve made a conscious choice to be part of the Google ecosystem,” says Hellström. “Google and Google Cloud understand marketing and the ad tech landscape better than anyone, and that makes it the perfect foundation for what we’re building next.”
