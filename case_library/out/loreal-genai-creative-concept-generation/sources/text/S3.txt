Reinforcing its commitment to beauty that is more personalized, inclusive and responsible, at Viva Technology in Paris, L’Oréal will unveil innovations that deliver ‘Beauty for Each, Powered by Beauty Tech’. They include a portfolio of cutting-edge skin and hair diagnostics, a GenAI-powered personal beauty assistant, a GenAI Beauty Content Lab called CREAITECH to augment creativity, and the most realistic, human skin-like technology platform for scientific research and product testing.
“Having pioneered Beauty Tech for years, we are firm believers that technology can push the boundaries of what’s possible for beauty to improve the lives of people around the world. With advanced diagnostics, augmented beauty services, GenAI assistants, augmented creativity in the GenAI era, and breakthrough electronic devices, we are shaping the beauty of the future to be more personalized, more inclusive and more responsible,” said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology, L’OréalGroupe.
“This week at VivaTech, alongside other breakthrough innovations, we are unveiling Skin Technology by L’Oréal: a new bioprinted skin that more closely mimics real human skin and opens up exciting possibilities for researchers across the cosmetic and health sectors.” Made possible by the convergence of biology, mechanics and electronics, Skin Technology by L’Oréalmore closely mimics the vast diversity of real, human skin, including conditions such as eczema and acne, as well as the ability to tan and heal from injury. L’Oréal is currently working with start-ups and renowned institutes worldwide on further developing the technology to enable skin that can actually feel. Skin Technology promises to raise the standards of product testing and encourage beauty without animal cruelty – a commitment of L’Oréal’s since 1989.
The Groupe is also debuting its in-house GenAI Beauty Content Lab, CREAITECH, an advanced lab with tools set to transform content production for the Groupe. CREAITECH is being used as a safe space for GenAI experimentation. CREAITECH allows L’Oréal to scale the creation of brand-compliant and localized content across its 37 beauty brands, and in parallel, upskill L’Oréal marketers on the latest creative technologies. The Groupe is also announcing a partnership with Meta and leading content creators to continue to push the boundaries of creativity.
“With human creativity, technology is at its most awe-inspiring, giving people a powerful tool for self-expression and brand expression,” said Asmita Dubey, Chief Digital and Marketing Officer, L’OréalGroupe. “Our CREAITECH GenAI Beauty Content Lab is a testament to what a human hand and a GenAI tool can achieve together in creativity. With our new Brand Custom Models, we can train GenAI to recognize the unique visual codes of our brands and launch innovative beauty campaigns faster. Importantly, we can do so without compromising our principles of responsible AI, which include notusing AI generated life-like images of the face, body, hair and skin to support or enhance product benefits in our external communication.”
Dubey continued: “Meanwhile, with Meta we unveil the New Codes of Beauty Creator Program to empower the next generation of 3D, AR, and AI creators and explore new creative frontiers in beauty. Our brands L'Oréal Paris, Lancôme, and La Roche-Posay are pioneering and embracing these new creative territories through collaborations with a squad of 30 creators adept at leveraging cutting-edge tools and techniques. Our goal is to unleash technological creativity in a rising creator economy.”
Barbara Lavernos and Asmita Dubey will co-headline L’Oréal’s keynote, “SHAPING THE FUTURE OF BEAUTY WITH BEAUTY TECH” at VivaTech on 22nd May on Stage 1. From 22-25 May, L’Oréal Beauty Tech experts at VivaTech will welcome guests and showcase the following innovations in booth F37.
