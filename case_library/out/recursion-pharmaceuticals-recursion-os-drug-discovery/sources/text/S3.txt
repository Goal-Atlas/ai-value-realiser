- In-licensed a program (Target Epsilon) that emerged from our fibrosis collaboration with Bayer that represents a novel approach to treating fibrotic diseases - now entering IND-enabling studies
- Already incorporating causal AI models into the Recursion OS trained using data from
Tempus after a mid-Q4 data partnership announced
“2023 was a year of remarkable progress for Recursion as we continued to demonstrate how combining technology, biology, chemistry, and patient data can industrialize drug discovery, and we look forward to the milestones ahead of us in 2024,” said
Summary of Business Highlights
- Platform
- Causal AI Modeling and Additional Datasets: We have been training causal AI models leveraging over 20 petabytes of multimodal precision oncology patient data from
Tempus to support the discovery of potential biomarker-enriched therapeutics at scale. By combining the forward genetics approach ofTempus with the reverse genetics approach at Recursion, we believe we have an opportunity to improve the speed, precision, and scale of therapeutic development in oncology. This work has already resulted in a directed-oncology program against a novel gene/disease relationship in a large oncology indication. Recursion intends to operate both as a data generator and multimodal data aggregator. In the future, we intend to augment our dataset and hone the Recursion OS with germline genetic data, organoid technologies, and automated nano-synthesis technologies. - LOWE (Large Language Model-Orchestrated Workflow Engine): LOWE is an LLM agent that represents the next evolution of the Recursion OS. LOWE supports drug discovery programs by orchestrating complex wet and dry-lab workflows via natural language prompts. These workflows are the steps and tools available in the Recursion OS, from finding significant relationships across biology, chemistry, and patient-centric data to generating novel compounds and scheduling them for synthesis and experimentation. Through its natural language interface and interactive graphics, LOWE can put state-of-the-art AI tools into the hands of every drug discovery scientist.

- Pipeline
- Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) (REC-994): Our Phase 2 SYCAMORE clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study of REC-994 in participants with CCM. This trial was fully enrolled in
June 2023 with 62 participants and the vast majority of participants who completed 12 months of treatment continue to elect to enter the long-term extension study. We expect to share Phase 2 data in Q3 2024. - Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) (REC-2282): Our adaptive Phase 2/3 POPLAR clinical trial is a randomized, two part study of REC-2282 in participants with progressive NF2-mutated meningiomas. Part 1 of the study is ongoing and is exploring two doses of REC-2282 in approximately 23 adults and 9 adolescents, with enrollment in adults expected to complete in H1 2024. We expect to share Phase 2 safety and preliminary efficacy data in Q4 2024.
- Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) (REC-4881): Our Phase 1b/2 TUPELO clinical trial is an open label, multicenter, two part study of REC-4881 in participants with FAP. Part 1 is complete with FPI for Part 2 anticipated in H1 2024. We expect to share Phase 2 safety and preliminary efficacy data in H1 2025.
- AXIN1 or APC Mutant Cancers (REC-4881): Our Phase 2 LILAC clinical trial is an open label, multicenter study of REC-4881 in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer with AXIN1 or APC mutations. This study was initiated at the end of 2023, with FPI anticipated in Q1 2024. We expect to share Phase 2 safety and preliminary efficacy data in H1 2025.
- Clostridioides difficile Infection (REC-3964): We conducted a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of REC-3964 at increasing oral doses in comparison with placebo. REC-3964 was safe and well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or TEAEs that led to discontinuation. REC-3964 is a first-in-class C. difficile toxin inhibitor and the first new chemical entity developed by Recursion, with promising preclinical efficacy data seen in relevant models (superiority versus bezlotoxumab). We expect to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2024.
- RBM39 HR-Proficient Ovarian Cancers and Other Solid Tumors: RBM39 is a novel CDK12-adjacent target identified by the Recursion OS. We intend to position our lead candidate as a single agent for the potential treatment of HR-proficient ovarian cancers and other HR-proficient solid tumors. As a result of our strategic collaboration with
Tempus , we are leveraging genomic data across all tumor types to identify clinical biomarkers for patient expansion. We are advancing our lead candidate through IND-enabling studies with IND submission expected in H2 2024. - Undisclosed Indication in Fibrosis (Target Epsilon): Phenotypic screening of human PBMCs identified novel and structurally diverse small molecules that reverse the phenotypic features of disease-state fibrocyte cells into those of healthy-state cells. The most promising compounds were confirmed as potent inhibitors of a novel target for fibrosis. This program originated under our initial fibrosis collaboration with Bayer and we have since in-licensed from Bayer all rights to this program which is now entering IND-enabling studies.
- Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) (REC-994): Our Phase 2 SYCAMORE clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study of REC-994 in participants with CCM. This trial was fully enrolled in
- Partnerships
- Transformational Collaborations: We continue to advance efforts to discover potential new therapeutics with our strategic partners in the areas of undruggable oncology (Bayer) as well as neuroscience and a single indication in gastrointestinal oncology (Roche-Genentech). In the near-term, there is the potential for option exercises associated with partnership programs, option exercises associated with map building initiatives or data sharing, and additional partnerships in large, intractable areas of biology or technological innovation.
- Enamine: In
December 2023 , we entered into a collaboration with Enamine to generate and design enriched compound libraries for the global drug discovery industry. By leveraging MatchMaker, a Recursion AI model, to identify compounds in the Enamine REAL Space (~36 billion chemical compounds) predicted to bind to high-value targets, we believe we can generate more powerful compound libraries for drug discovery purposes. Enamine may offer the resulting libraries to customers for purchase and will co-brand any libraries under both the Enamine and Recursion’s trademarks. This collaboration is an example of how select data layers can drive value in novel ways.
