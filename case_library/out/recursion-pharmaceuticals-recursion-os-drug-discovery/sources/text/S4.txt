Recursion Gives Guidance on Seven Clinical Readouts within ~18 Months and Partnership Updates at Their Download Day
- Recursion delivered multiple data packages to Bayer and initiated the first joint oncology project, which is now expected to advance rapidly towards Lead Series nomination
- Bayer to become first external beta-user of LOWE (LLM-Orchestrated Workflow Engine) for drug discovery and development
“Since our last Download Day, which was approximately 18 months ago, we have seen various industries increasingly embrace AI/ML solutions. This adoption has also played out in the drug discovery space,” said
The event will feature a number of prominent speakers, including
Updated pipeline guidance:
- Seven Clinical Trial Readouts expected within approximately 18 months:
- REC-994 Cerebral Cavernous Malformation—topline Phase 2 data readout in
September 2024 ; - REC-2282 Neurofibromatosis Type 2—preliminary Phase 2 data readout in the fourth quarter of 2024;
- REC-4881 Familial Adenomatous Polyposis—preliminary Phase 2 data readout in the first half of 2025;
- REC-4881 Advanced AXIN1/APC-Mutant Cancers—preliminary Phase 2 data readout in the first half of 2025;
- REC-3964 Clostridioides difficile Infection—Phase 2 study initiation in the fourth quarter of 2024 and preliminary data readout by the end of 2025;
- RBM39 Advanced HR-Proficient Cancers—IND submission in the third quarter of 2024, Phase 1/2 initiation in the fourth quarter of 2024 and Phase 1 dose-escalation data readout by the end of 2025;
- Target Epsilon (Fibrotic Diseases)—IND submission in early 2025 and Phase 1 healthy volunteer study data readout by the end of 2025.
- REC-994 Cerebral Cavernous Malformation—topline Phase 2 data readout in
- Dozens of internal and partner programs in early stages with the first LLM and causal model driven programs entering the Recursion pipeline.
Partnership updates
- Bayer will be the first beta-user of our LOWE LLM-orchestrated workflow software, which will be integrated across the collaboration and offer a more exploratory, and intuitive research environment for scientists on both sides.
- Additional updates pertaining to the Bayer partnership include:
- We initiated our first joint oncology project which is now expected to advance rapidly towards Lead Series nomination; and
- We are on track to complete 25 unique multi-modal data packages that we expect to deliver in the third quarter of 2024.
Platform updates
- ADME industrialization: potential to achieve an estimated 90 times the amount of lab throughput over a manual approach.
- Built our first genome-scale transcriptomics knockout map.
- Multimodal mapping has enabled us in certain experiments to achieve 90% success on our ability to predict compounds that failed later disease-relevant assays in internal tests and 60% ability to predict compounds that passed later disease-relevant assays in internal tests.
- Helix partnership brings hundreds of thousands of unique de-identified patient records across diverse therapeutic areas.
