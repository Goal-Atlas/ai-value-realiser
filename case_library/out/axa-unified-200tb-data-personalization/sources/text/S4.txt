This case study explores the implementation of Easy Redmine, showcasing its tailored solutions for the Czech and Slovak markets under the brand Easy Project.
Before using Easy Redmine
AXA Group Czech Republic and Slovakia sought to introduce a project portfolio management system for its project office in collaboration with various departments. Initially, Easy Redmine was rolled out to the project office in a pilot phase and was later extended to other departments.
The client specifically required a tool for resource management to better oversee project resources both at the departmental level and for individual team members.
Prior to implementing Easy Redmine, AXA Group Czech Republic and Slovakia faced challenges in managing their project portfolios effectively. The absence of a centralized project management system led to fragmented processes, limited visibility into resource allocation, and inefficiencies in project tracking and reporting.
Challenges
- Decentralized project management: Projects were managed using disparate tools, leading to inconsistencies and communication gaps.
- Inefficient resource allocation: Lack of a unified system hindered effective planning and utilization of resources.
- Limited reporting capabilities: Difficulty in generating transparent and comprehensive reports for management review.
- Data security concerns: The need for an on-premises solution to ensure data sovereignty and compliance with internal policies.
Requirements for project management software
- Enhanced document management
- Intuitive personal dashboards
- Optimal capacity planning and resource management
- Project evaluation
- On-premises deployment
- Data security
Key requirements of AXA Group

Implementation
AXA initiated the implementation of Easy Redmine with a pilot phase involving the project office, focusing on defining fundamental requirements and testing the platform’s capabilities. Following successful validation, the solution was rolled out to other departments through a structured approach.
Implementation steps
- Pilot phase: Conducted to identify and define key requirements, which were integrated into Easy Redmine.
- Stakeholder engagement: Active involvement of key users from the project office to ensure alignment with organizational needs.
- Iterative deployment: Implementation executed through weekly sprints, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.
- Training and support: Provided to ensure smooth adoption and effective utilization of the new system.
Setup and project templates
The first step involved setting up a clear project structure, defining all user roles, and customising their personal dashboards.
Project templates were also created, enabling teams to quickly and easily start new projects with standardised settings.
These templates save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across all projects, allowing for more efficient management and improved team productivity.
Results and benefits using Easy Redmine

On-premises solution
AXA Group Czech Republic and Slovakia chose an on-premises solution to meet their security needs. Initially, we set up the system environment on a temporary cloud before migrating the entire system to the client’s own server. Further changes to the application were made remotely through remote access to the server.
