IHG Hotels & Resorts showcased its interest in innovative guest engagement technologies at SXSW Sydney 2024 with the unveiling of its “Mind Lobby.” This experimental activation utilized eye-tracking technology to analyze travelers’ subconscious reactions to various travel destinations, aiming to reveal their true preferences and combat decision fatigue.
The Mind Lobby experience involved participants viewing a series of images and videos showcasing different travel destinations while their eye movements and pupil dilation were tracked. This data was then analyzed by an algorithm that identified patterns and correlations, ultimately categorizing the participant’s subconscious preferences into one of five distinct travel typologies: Culinary Indulgence, City Escape, Sundrenched Retreat, Holistic Haven, and Remote Escapism.
While the effectiveness of this technology in accurately determining subconscious desires is still under evaluation, the “Mind Lobby” represents a broader trend within the hospitality industry: a growing focus on personalization and leveraging data-driven insights to enhance the guest experience.
This initiative comes in response to research conducted by IHG Hotels & Resorts, which revealed that a significant number of Australian travelers feel overwhelmed by the abundance of travel options. The research found that 61% of Aussie travelers feel overwhelmed by important decisions, with 41% citing choosing a holiday destination as one of their top stressors. This decision fatigue can lead to dissatisfaction with travel choices, as travelers may feel pressured to make quick decisions or settle for convenient options rather than what they truly desire.
IHG’s “Mind Lobby” experiment, while still in its early stages, suggests the company is exploring new and innovative ways to address this challenge. By leveraging technology to understand travelers’ subconscious preferences, IHG aims to provide more personalized recommendations and streamline the decision-making process.
This focus on personalization and data-driven insights is also evident in IHG’s other recent technology initiatives. The company has invested heavily in its IHG One Rewards mobile app, which has become its fastest-growing booking channel. The app offers a range of features designed to personalize the guest experience and streamline the travel journey, including Travel Wishlists, Wi-Fi Auto Connect, real-time room charges, room details and customization options, a seamless loyalty benefits experience, and an updated Wallet.
Beyond the mobile app, IHG has invested over $300 million in recent years in its technology platforms, including its guest reservation system, brand websites, and cloud-based data analytics capabilities. The company is also testing attribute-based booking, which allows guests to select rooms based on specific attributes, and is encouraging more guests to use chat-based customer interaction for faster and more efficient support.
Last year, IHG launched a reimagined digital booking experience that offers greater personalization for guests. This new platform, powered by next-generation cloud solutions, allows guests to select individual room attributes and personalize their stays with in-room welcome amenities, food and beverage credits, pre-paid parking, and the use of their IHG One Rewards elite-qualifying bonus points.
These technological advancements are benefiting both guests and hoteliers. Guests enjoy a more personalized and seamless travel experience, while hotels see increased revenue from upselling and enhanced guest satisfaction.
IHG’s partnership with Apple has led to the introduction of AirPlay in hotel rooms, allowing guests to seamlessly share content from their Apple devices to their guest room TVs. The company also launched IHG Wi-Fi Auto Connect, a feature that automatically connects IHG One Rewards members to hotel Wi-Fi upon arrival, eliminating the need for login credentials.
IHG plans to continue enhancing its mobile app with new features, such as virtual 360° tours of select Hotel Indigo properties and the ability for guests to share Wishlists with friends and family. The company is also investing in rebuilding each hotel’s website and standardizing room type definitions globally, further demonstrating its commitment to providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across its portfolio.
IHG’s ongoing investment in technology, its strategic partnerships with leading technology providers, and its focus on data-driven insights are positioning the company as a leader in the evolving landscape of hotel technology. By embracing innovation and prioritizing the guest experience, IHG aims to create a more personalized, seamless, and rewarding travel journey for its guests.
