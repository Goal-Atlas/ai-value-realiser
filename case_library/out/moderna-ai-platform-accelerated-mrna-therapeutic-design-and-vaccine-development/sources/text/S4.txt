The power of mRNA
Our scientists are developing mRNA medicines to help prevent or treat disease.
It’s all about proteins
At Moderna, we are working on developing and testing new mRNA medicines for a wide range of diseases.
We start with a protein
All mRNA medicines start with identifying a protein that is designed to prevent or treat a certain disease.
Then we design the mRNA
Our scientists design an mRNA that carries instructions for this protein.
And repeat this process to create other medicines
To make mRNA vaccines or therapeutics, our scientists create instructions to make different proteins that could help our body fight infections or prevent diseases.
We have an extensive pipeline
In addition to mRNA vaccines, Moderna is working on other applications of potential mRNA therapeutics that could help people with cancer, metabolic diseases and more.
mRNA is a modern approach to medicine
10+ years
At Moderna, we’ve been working on mRNA medicines for more than 10 years.
mRNA expertise
Our scientists are experts in creating mRNA medicines. They worked very hard to refine our process for making mRNA medicine.
Rigorous testing
Like all medicines and medical products, mRNA medicines and vaccines are being rigorously tested in clinical trials for safety and efficacy.
Innovative medicines
mRNA products can be created rapidly, which is one of the reasons why mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 were created so quickly.
mRNA is transformational
With our technology, we are revolutionizing medicine and developing potential mRNA treatments in shorter periods of time for previously untreatable and emerging diseases.
We can positively impact the lives of millions of people
Our mRNA platform, with its speed, scale and flexibility, is uniquely suited to tackle current and emerging pathogens that threaten global health.
mRNA research and innovation
Our research and design services enable us and our partners to advance new product ideas into development candidates.
Our infrastructure enables rapid supply of thousands of pre-clinical mRNAs for in vitro and in vivo research to accelerate programs from idea to development candidate designation.
Our Research Engine
Our Research Engine combines proprietary digital drug design tools and a highly automated production facility to enable Moderna to advance mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.
Scientists can select any protein in the human proteome to be engineered or they can design novel proteins. All can be designed to explore previously undiscovered pathways.
mRNA DESIGN STUDIO™
Our mRNA DESIGN STUDIO enables rapid design of multiple mRNAs.
As the DIGITAL BIOTECH COMPANY™, we maximize the utility of mRNA in our proprietary, web-based mRNA DESIGN STUDIO.
Protein targeting
Our scientists request mRNAs for a specific protein.
The protein target is automatically converted to an initial optimized mRNA sequence.
Using our Sequence Designer module, they can tailor entire mRNAs from the 5’-UTR to the coding region to the 3’-UTR based on our ever-improving proprietary learnings.
mRNA tailoring
Our proprietary in-house digital application suite contains a Sequence Designer module to tailor an entire mRNA.
mRNA DESIGN STUDIO utilizes cloud-based computational capacity to run various algorithms we have developed to design each mRNA sequence.
Parallel design
The utility of cloud-based capacity allows us to provide flexible computational capacity on demand.
This allows the Research Engine to power parallel intake and design of multiple mRNA sequences.
Automation platforms
The mRNA DESIGN STUDIO integrates with Moderna’s automation platforms–directing orders through each phase of mRNA synthesis.
Once the order is placed, Moderna’s high-throughput mRNA pre-clinical production facility manages the manufacturing of mRNA constructs and delivers them in just weeks.
mRNA early development engine
Across our internally developed and partnered mRNA programs, we are simultaneously advancing mRNA development candidates for many diseases into and through clinical studies.
Our services
Our mRNA EARLY DEVELOPMENT ENGINE™ services combine internal and external capabilities for process development, toxicology studies, global regulatory interactions and clinical study preparation, and execution for our mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.
These services are designed to deliver many investigational mRNA vaccines and therapeutics to human proof of concept data.
