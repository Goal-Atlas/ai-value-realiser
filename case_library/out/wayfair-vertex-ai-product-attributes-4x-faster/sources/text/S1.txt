AI is here, AI is everywhere: Top companies, governments, researchers, and startups are already enhancing their work with Google's AI solutions.
Published April 12, 2024; last updated October 9, 2025.
A year and a half ago, during Google Cloud Next 24, we published this list for the first time. It numbered 101 entries.
It felt like a lot at the time, and served as a showcase of how much momentum both Google and the industry were seeing around generative AI adoption. In the brief period then of gen AI being widely available, organizations of all sizes had begun experimenting with it and putting it into production across their work and across the world, doing so at a speed rarely seen with new technology.
What a difference these past months have made. Our list has now grown by 10X. And still, that’s just scratching the surface of what’s becoming possible with AI across the enterprise, or what might be coming in the next year and a half.
Many of these use cases are coming to life this week at our Gemini at Work event, which you can watch live today.
Mercedes Benz is building cars that can converse with their drivers while Mercari, Japan’s largest online marketplace, and Commerzbank are making it easier than ever to reach a customer service agent — Mercari even anticipates a 500% ROI while reducing employee workloads by 20%. And talk about scale: Virgin Voyages is using Veo’s text-to-video features to create thousands of hyper-personalized ads and emails in a single go without sacrificing brand voice or style. Nor are they alone. Figma, which calls itself the “collaborative interface design tool,” lets any organization create high-quality, brand-approved images and assets in seconds.
[Looking for how to build AI use cases just like these? Check out our handy guide with 101 technical blueprints from some of these real-world examples.]
Given the incredible pace of innovation and progress we continue to see, we are confident that AI will grow beyond even our imagination as our customers continue to challenge us to design, build, deploy, and create value.
Hopefully you find something here that will propel our own AI endeavors together.
The list is organized by 11 major industry groups, and within those, six agent types: Customer, Employee, Creative, Code, Data, and Security. There are 400 new entries in this edition, denoted with an asterisk (*) before the organization’s name.
