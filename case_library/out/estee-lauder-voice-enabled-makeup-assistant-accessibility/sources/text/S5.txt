The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) U.K. and Ireland have launched the Voice-Enabled Makeup Assistant (VMA) application, an artificial intelligence-powered mobile app to help visually impaired users more easily and confidently apply makeup.
The move follows recent beauty accessibility launches, including L'Oréal's HAPTA handheld computerized makeup applicator for users with limited hand and arm mobility.
The app is designed to support the visually impaired community by further enabling self-expression and self-empowerment through their relationship with makeup.
VMA uses voice instruction technologies to assist the user in makeup application by giving audio feedback and tips on whether their lipstick, eyeshadow, or foundation is evenly applied.
The app identifies makeup applied on a user’s face and assesses the uniformity and boundaries of application and coverage. VMA identifies any areas on the face that may require more accurate application and audibly describes where touch ups may be needed.
It will initially be available via the Apple App Store in the United Kingdom and esteelauder.co.uk and is targeted to launch on the Google Play store within the year and across other ELC brands and markets in the near future.
Michael Smith, chief information officer, The Estée Lauder Companies, said, "We are committed to building innovative technology solutions that make beauty truly inclusive to everyone. We are thrilled to bring the experience of independently applying makeup to the millions of people that are visually impaired. Technology is a powerful tool to drive inclusion and we are delighted to be first to market with this pioneering app.”
Monica Rastogi, executive director, corporate cultural relevancy and inclusion and diversity, The Estée Lauder Companies U.K. and Ireland, said, "As a company, we are deeply committed to playing our part in creating an inclusive beauty industry. The launch of our Voice-Enabled Makeup Assistant is an important step in our journey towards makeup accessibility for all by removing barriers to engaging with beauty products and services.”
