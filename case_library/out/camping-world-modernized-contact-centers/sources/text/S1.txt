Using AI in Modernizing Call Centers - Course Monster Blog
AI. Imagine this scenario: A traveler goes on a camping trip and decides to extend their RV rental during their trip. However, when they try to call customer service for help, they have a difficult time getting through and are redirected multiple times. The process becomes frustrating and causes them to question whether the additional rental is worth the hassle. From the perspective of the customer service agent, they are also dealing with a frustrated customer and trying to gather information quickly, which can be stressful. These types of situations are unfortunately common and can be costly for the company, as well as frustrating for both the customer and the agent.
Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in improving customer service through conversational solutions. These solutions allow organizations to better meet customer expectations, streamline operations, and reduce expenses while also increasing customer satisfaction. By implementing AI into customer service processes, companies can achieve more cost-effective operations and satisfied customers.
In today’s fast-paced environment, how can conversational AI assist in meeting customer expectations?
By implementing conversational AI in your call center, you can achieve the following benefits:
- Increased customer and agent satisfaction. Prolonged wait times and unanswered questions can lead to dissatisfaction for both customers and agents, as well as hinder the efficiency of the business. However, by utilizing advanced natural language understanding (NLU) and automation, resolution can be achieved more quickly, leading to a win-win situation for all parties involved.
- Improved call resolution rates. AI and machine learning can provide more self-service options and route customers to the appropriate support channels, using data from past customer interactions to improve responses. This also helps agents handle high call volumes more effectively and improve resolution rates, leading to better customer experiences and a stronger brand reputation.
- Reduced operational costs. By using AI-powered virtual agents, it is possible to handle up to 70% of calls automatically, potentially saving your business an estimated $5.50 per contained call and saving time for customers.
Not all AI platforms are built the same
At the most basic level, you have AI bots that follow a set of predetermined rules and can only provide limited responses. For example, if you call customer service for your telecom provider and ask about an unlimited data plan, you might be asked a series of questions based on strict if-then scenarios “…say yes if you want to review service plans; say yes if you want unlimited data.”
One step higher on the AI ladder is level two AI with machine learning and intent detection. For example, if you accidentally type “speal to an agenr,” this type of virtual assistant would be able to understand your intention and provide a proper response: “I’m sorry, did you mean to say ‘speak to an agent’?”
IBM Watson® Assistant is a virtual agent that constantly learns and utilizes extensive resources. It is classified as level three AI, which is the most advanced and powerful form of AI with access to vast amounts of data and research capabilities.
IBM Watson Assistant, deployed at Vodafone, a leading telecommunications company in Germany, exhibits level three capabilities. In addition to answering questions across various platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and RCS, it can also retrieve and respond to requests from databases and communicate in multiple languages. It is able to analyze data, customize interactions, and continually learn and improve. “*Insert Name*, transferring you to one of our agents who can answer your question about coverage abroad.”
Why add complexity when you can simplify with AI?
A Gartner® report predicts that by 2031, chatbots and virtual assistants powered by conversational AI will handle 30% of interactions that would have previously been handled by human agents, an increase from the 2% projected for 2022. To stay competitive, modern contact centers need to keep up with AI advancements. Leading companies, like Watson, continuously learn and analyze data in order to continually improve and evolve.
Watson Assistant can be easily integrated into your company’s infrastructure and provides reliable, user-friendly support and self-service options. For example, Camping World, the top retailer of recreational vehicles, used IBM Watson AI-powered virtual assistant Arvee to handle an increase in customer demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. By implementing Arvee in their call center, Camping World was able to improve agent efficiency by 33% and increase customer engagement by 40%.
