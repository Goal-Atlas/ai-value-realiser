Our Product
We are committed to increasing the use of more responsibly sourced and certified key raw materials in our product by spring 2030*. Our design and merchandising teams are dedicated to embedding this commitment early in the design stage, while our innovation team is focused on sourcing next-gen materials and process alternatives that will help us decarbonise our business.
As of 2024, we’re proud to say that the gabardine fabric used for our Heritage Trench Coats is woven from 100 per cent organically grown cotton** at our heritage manufacturing sites in Yorkshire, England.
Within beauty, we have already launched our first refillable fragrances, Burberry Goddess and Burberry Hero 100ml, and will be expanding our refillable offering with selected new beauty products and fragrances in the near future.
Trench for Tomorrow
Our Trench for Tomorrow initiative ensures that our Heritage Trench and Car Coats are made with lower-impact materials and can be worn for as long as possible with the help of our ReBurberry Services.
Made in England for more than a century, our coats are crafted using Burberry’s signature gabardine fabric, which is now woven from 100 per cent organically grown cotton**. Organic cotton** is a less chemical and water-intensive alternative to conventionally produced cotton. The buttons on these styles are also made from 90 per cent bio-based resin, which is a renewable natural resource derived from plants.
At our manufacturing sites in Castleford and Keighley, which both run on 100 per cent renewable electricity, it takes a year for each specialist tailor to master the stitching of the intricate trench coat collar.
To help ensure our trench and car coats are enjoyed for years to come, we offer a range of circular services including Trench Refresh, Reproofing, Repair, Rental and Resale.
Scarf for Tomorrow
Our current styles are made from cashmere at Johnstons of Elgin, a 225-year-old Scottish mill that is B Corp certified and runs on 100 per cent renewable energy. Johnstons is also our longest standing partner of over 120 years and shares our commitment to responsible craftsmanship.
Our Packaging
Widely recyclable, the paper we use is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) certified and we’ve also introduced a reusable, 100 per cent recycled cotton tote bag that will be used to package selected coats and jackets.
Our rainwear and tailoring are packaged with an FSC-certified wooden hanger and in a reusable cotton garment cover that contains a minimum of 60 per cent recycled cotton. We have removed all hardware, such as zips and press studs, to ensure the garment covers are not only plastic free but made from a single material – allowing them to be more easily recycled in order to support a circular economy.
