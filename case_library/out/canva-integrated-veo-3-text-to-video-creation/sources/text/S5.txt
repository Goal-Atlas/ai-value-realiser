Quotes from Canva:
Cameron Adams, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Canva: “Enabling anyone to bring their ideas to life – especially their most creative ones – has been core to Canva's mission ever since we set out to empower the world to design. By democratising access to a powerful technology like Google’s Veo 3 inside Canva AI, your big ideas can now be brought to life in the highest quality video and sound, all from within your existing Canva subscription. In true Canva fashion, we’ve built this with an intuitive interface and simple editing tools in place, all backed by Canva Shield.”
Danny Wu, Head of AI Products, Canva: We’re taking video creation on Canva to the next level by integrating one of this year’s biggest AI innovations, Google’s Veo 3 model, into Canva AI. Video is increasingly critical to our community and now it's never been easier to create stunning clips with perfectly synchronised dialogue and rich, immersive soundscapes. This is a step change in AI-powered creativity, and we’re thrilled to partner with Google on being one of the first platforms to offer Veo 3.”
