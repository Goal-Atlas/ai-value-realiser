Canva has launched a new feature, Create a Video Clip, that allows users to generate short video clips with audio using a text prompt. The tool is powered by Google’s Veo 3, the company’s latest video generation model, and marks one of the first integrations of the technology since its release.
The feature enables users to produce 8-second video clips directly from the Canva interface. These clips open in Canva’s built-in video editor, where they can be further customised using branding tools, text, music, and other elements. The videos can also be added to social media posts, presentations or other formats available on the platform.
The feature is available to Canva users on paid plans, including Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Canva for Nonprofits. Access is limited to five video generations per month initially, with plans to extend usage in the future. The tool is also rolling out to users on the Leonardo.Ai platform.
According to Canva, the integration is part of its multi-model approach, which aims to consolidate creative tools in a single platform. Users can already generate text, images, and full design layouts with Canva AI. The addition of video generation brings a new format to the existing workflow.
Canva said Create a Video Clip will be moderated under its Canva Shield framework, which includes safety checks to prevent the production of harmful or unsafe content and offers indemnity for eligible enterprise users. Wu wrote that this is part of ensuring AI-powered creativity remains “safe and responsible.”
Create a Video Clip is accessible from the Canva homepage and sidebar under the Canva AI section. Users can input a prompt describing the desired content and generate a video in seconds.

Danny Wu, Head of AI Products at Canva, wrote in a blog post that the tool expands the platform’s AI capabilities by offering video generation within the same space where users already design and create. He described the feature as part of a broader effort to “put powerful, professional tools in the hands of everyone.”
