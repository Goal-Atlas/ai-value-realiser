Google’s Veo 3 model now powers AI video generation on Canva, the company announced in a press release today. The new feature allows users to generate 8-second video clips with synchronized audio using voice or text prompts in a single workflow. The tool is available to Canva’s paid and nonprofit users as well as Leonardo.Ai subscribers (starting at $10/month). For those unaware, Leonardo.Ai is owned by Canva. The integration brings cinematic-style video creation to millions without the need for specialized software or skills.To recall, Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts. This includes speech such as dialogues and voice-overs; and audio, such as music and sound effects.Canva also revealed its plan to acquire MagicBrief, an AI-driven creative platform used by marketing and design teams worldwide. Both announcements highlight Canva’s growing investment in AI-powered content creation and creative tools.Cameron Adams, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Canva said: “Enabling anyone to bring their ideas to life – especially their most creative ones – has been core to Canva's mission ever since we set out to empower the world to design. By democratizing access to a powerful technology like Google’s Veo 3 inside Canva AI, your big ideas can now be brought to life in the highest quality video and sound, all from within your existing Canva subscription. In true Canva fashion, we’ve built this with an intuitive interface and simple editing tools in place, all backed by Canva Shield.”YouTube to add Google Veo 3 to ShortsIn a related news, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan recently announced that the video platform will soon integrate Google’s most advanced AI video generation tool, Veo 3. The AI video tool is coming later this summer.Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless. A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution.”He continued “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers. Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”https://youtu.be/p8dDE8HY7T4
