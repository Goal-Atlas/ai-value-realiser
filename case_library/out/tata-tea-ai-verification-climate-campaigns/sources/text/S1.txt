Tata Tea Jaago Re uses AI verification to measure the positive impact of performing small daily actions to fight climate change.
The most effective corporate social responsibility initiatives share a common trait: they transform passive support into active participation. For Tata Consumer Products Limited (TCPL), that principle would drive a complete reimagining of how the company measures real-world impact.
Part of the $180 billion-revenue Tata Group, TCPL is one of India's largest consumer goods companies with a portfolio spanning tea, coffee, water, and packaged foods. For more than a decade, its Tata Tea Jaago Re platform has awakened Indians to critical social issues, from corruption to women's electoral participation. As a purpose-led marketing initiative for the entire Tata Tea brand portfolio, Jaago Re has earned significant credibility through campaigns that challenge citizens to take action on issues that matter.
In recent years, the platform focused on climate change as a defining crisis, successfully driving awareness through emotionally resonant campaigns. The campaigns went viral, driving hundreds of thousands to the Jaago Re website to pledge action. In order to take the next step to drive collective social action however, the team faced a fundamental challenge. It was the belief held by people that they alone could not make a difference to an issue like climate change. But with modern technology it is now possible to quantify the impact of small actions. This insight drove the Tata Tea Jaago Re team to use AI to help citizens visualize the powerful collective impact of their small actions. As Puneet Das, President – Packaged Beverages and Organic India at Tata Consumer Products, explains, "We needed to move from awareness to action, and then eventually to advocacy. The challenge was helping people see that their small efforts — such as taking the metro or saving water while bathing — actually add up to something meaningful. That's where AI came in."
After a multi-vendor evaluation, TCPL selected Google Cloud to support the advanced AI capabilities it needed to support this vision. It also partnered with Niveus Solutions to build a WhatsApp front end for the initiative, creating an AI-validated climate-action experience at national scale.
Tata Tea chose to leverage WhatsApp as a means to engage people through a trusted channel they already used. Upon opening the initiative's front end, users are prompted to select from four pre-validated green actions, then submit a photo of themselves engaging in eco-conscious actions – such as using public transport, cooking with a lid, or bathing with a bucket instead of a shower.
Gemini analyzes the image, checking parameters for authenticity: Is the lid on the pot? Is the flame on underneath? The system responds with impact calculations, verifying these green actions and providing real-time insights into their environmental impact, reinforcing the idea that small steps can have a great impact. The calculations are completed in approximately three to four seconds to deliver photo verifications approximately 10–15 seconds — a step-up from manual validation that previously took up to five minutes per image.
The system was tuned with defined tolerances to give users the benefit of the doubt. "This campaign is not about auditing people's efforts; it is about nudging them into action," says Puneet Das. That balance between accuracy and friction proved essential to maintaining user trust while scaling participation.
The backend architecture powers instant validation through:
"The biggest benefit was the instant feedback provided to consumers," says Das. "It's framed evocatively to build confidence that their small actions make a tangible difference." For example, instead of 'you saved 2.5 kg of CO₂,' the system says 'that's equivalent to planting 20 trees.' This reframing has been audited by DQS for accuracy.
The platform reached 200 million people across multimedia platforms within two months of launch. 150,000 visitors checked out the JaagoRe website in this period to learn more about the tool.
