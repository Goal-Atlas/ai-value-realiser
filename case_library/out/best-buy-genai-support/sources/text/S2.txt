Best Buy used Vertex AI to launch cost-efficient, real-time features — by integrating powerful large language models with in-house solutions — that enhance the online shopping experience and boost customer trust, satisfaction, and revenue.
Electronics retailer Best Buy is bringing the in-store shopping experience home with advanced AI solutions from Google Cloud. Its Gift Finder tool, built on Vertex AI, uses generative AI to simulate a human-like shopping assistant, helping customers select thoughtful gifts by understanding their preferences. Meanwhile, summarization capabilities help the team condense thousands of product reviews into concise insights, improving customer trust and streamlining buying decisions. The team also uses Gemini to generate accurate answers to customers' product queries, based on product manuals and vendor-provided product information, to bridge the gap between digital and in-person experiences.
Best Buy selected Google Cloud for its advanced AI capabilities and ease of implementation. The flexibility to work with a mix of powerful large language models and homegrown solutions allowed Best Buy to quickly deploy real-time personalization features that meet customers' high expectations. With Google Cloud as its foundation, Best Buy has accelerated experimentation-to-production cycles, enabling teams to deliver better solutions, faster, and at a fraction of the cost. Together, these innovations have increased customer satisfaction, improved trust, and optimized revenue generation.
