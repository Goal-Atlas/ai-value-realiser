Best Buy humanizes the customer support experience
How generative AI is shaping the future of service at the electronics retail giant
3-MINUTE READ
Generative AI (gen AI) is shaking things up in the world of customer and employee experience by making interactions smoother, more relevant and more personalized. For customers, gen AI brings convenient self-service options like virtual assistants that give timely and spot-on answers to their queries. And for employees, gen AI tools can offer real-time tips and recommended solutions for addressing customer needs.
But here's the kicker: while gen AI is poised to be a game-changer for many companies—97% of organizations we surveyed believe it's going to be transformative—only 31% have invested significantly in the technology. In retail, Best Buy is leading the pack. The company has teamed up with Accenture and Google to develop innovative, personalized gen AI solutions that enhance the support experience for both customers and employees.
Case in point: a new gen AI-powered virtual assistant that provides customers with a self-service support option when they shop on BestBuy.com, use the Best Buy app, or call Best Buy customer support. Using the assistant, customers can quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling, and even manage their software and Geek Squad subscriptions and My Best Buy Memberships™.
And, if customers still want to chat with a real person to get the support they need, no problem! The virtual assistant connects them to one of Best Buy’s thousands of care agents who are also equipped with gen AI tools to solve customer queries and issues faster than ever before. The tools assess customer conversations in real-time and provide relevant recommendations and guidance. They can also detect sentiment and use data from calls to prevent similar issues in the future. Other tools automate routine tasks such as navigating knowledge bases, so agents can spend less time searching for info and more time understanding and empathizing with the customer.
At Best Buy we look at how gen AI can help enable our overall enterprise strategy while solving real human needs. We’re implementing it in very strategic ways across our organization to personalize and humanize the consumer electronics shopping experience like no one else can.
