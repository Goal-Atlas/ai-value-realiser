Bricorama and Accenture have collaborated to develop ‘pAInt,’ a generative AI-powered shopping assistant that helps customers with their painting projects. Available on bricorama.fr, ‘pAInt’ has been designed to inspire and guide customers through each stage of their projects, from inspiration – by suggesting trending styles, to the purchase of materials, to best practice guides on the painting process itself. This new service enables the brand to offer its customers a unique online experience, and to accompany them to the successful completion of their ‘Do-It-Yourself’ (DIY) projects.
Generative Artificial Intelligence to enhance the customer experience
‘pAInt’ is a conversational tool that customers can interact with for help with paint colors and finishes, decorating ideas from Bricorama’s video content, demonstrations, paint quantity, brushes and other accessories. Customers can then buy any of the products with a single click.
“We're proud to offer such an innovative and cutting-edge online service as ‘pAInt.’ It is further proof of our value proposition: to inspire and pedagogically support our customers in the success of their projects,” comments Laurent Pussat, president of Les Mousquetaires Group's DIY chains. “Our customers expect a personalized, professional response, whatever the channel they choose. With ‘pAInt,’ we're offering a 'made-to-measure' online experience, which can then be rolled out in-store, as an extension of its omnichannel purpose."
A project born from close collaboration between Bricorama and Accenture
Responding to customers’ growing need for DIY and decoration support, ‘pAInt’ was developed thanks to a close collaboration between Bricorama and Accenture Song, Accenture's tech-powered creative group. The teams analyzed and mapped the value and opportunities that generative AI could bring to the DIY market. They then used this information to develop the ‘pAInt’ tool and services relating to Bricorama products. The use of generative AI is set to be extended to other product categories. At the point of sale, employees will also be able to use the tool to advise customers.
The new ‘pAInt’ tool was built on OpenAI Service, to benefit from Azure’s enterprise-grade security, stability and performance, as well as its natural language interaction and context understanding capabilities. It has been trained with patented content produced by Bricorama, which has enabled it to acquire an extremely high level of expertise.
Laurent Thoumine, senior managing director, and Europe lead for Accenture’s retail industry group, said: “Generative AI has the potential to be a real game-changer in retail and is driving companies to reinvent how they run their businesses, serve their customers, and get work done. That’s why it’s particularly great to see Bricorama lean in strongly on this exciting new technology, and through working closely and quickly with our team, design and deliver a tool that offers hyper-relevant retail suggestions to each customer in each decision-making moment.”
