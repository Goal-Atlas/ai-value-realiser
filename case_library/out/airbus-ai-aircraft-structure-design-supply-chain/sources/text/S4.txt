Atlas AI’s GeoAI platform is now delivering predictive AI models for travel demand forecasting, airport catchment analysis, and infrastructure change detection. These technologies are unlocking new insights to guide supply chain strategies in dynamic and volatile markets
Palo Alto, CA — Atlas AI today announces their collaboration with Airbus SE, the global aerospace leader, to deploy Atlas AI’s geospatial AI (GeoAI) platform for long-term demand sensing in global aviation supply chains. This initiative is designed to provide the analytical tools and predictive capabilities for Airbus SE to incorporate hyperlocal aviation market forecasts and inform Airbus’ supply chain and commercial strategies for some of the most rapidly growing aviation markets globally.
"By partnering with Airbus SE, we're leveraging our GeoAI platform to provide hyper-local demand forecasts in rapidly growing travel markets such as the Asia-Pacific region. Our platform's predictive capabilities allow Airbus to anticipate market dynamics and infrastructure needs with unprecedented granularity. This collaboration demonstrates how AI-driven insights can inform strategic decision-making in highly dynamic and diverse markets, enabling Airbus to optimize their planning and resource allocation in these emerging aviation hubs," said Abe Tarapani, CEO of Atlas AI.
Atlas AI’s platform leverages the company’s advanced geospatial technologies, including predictive AI models for travel demand forecasting, airport catchment analysis, and infrastructure change detection. The platform analyzes petabytes of satellite imagery, mobility data, demographic trends, infrastructure, land use, and energy market dynamics around networks of airports. Underlying the platform is the Atlas AI Image Data Science EngineTM, which enables wide area mapping and monitoring of economic development patterns. These data are critical to understanding dynamic markets and forecasting their growth, but such inputs have historically been unavailable to enterprise data science teams such as the Global Markets Forecast team at Airbus.
In the initial deployment phase of the collaboration, Atlas AI's technology demonstrated an ability to develop bottom-up forecasts that better reflect the dynamic and heterogeneous growth profile of the initial markets being tested. The team’s level of granularity and adaptability in forecasting could significantly improve Airbus’ understanding of rapidly evolving markets, aiding in better anticipating future air travel demands and trends.
Understanding future travel patterns at granular levels may also support sustainable aviation planning. Route-level forecasts have the potential to provide unprecedented visibility into emerging markets, helping determine the most efficient types and sizes of aircraft for different routes. As the aviation industry expands, particularly in high-growth regions, GeoAI will play a crucial role in enabling efficient economic growth, offering new pathways to balance rapid market expansion while exercising environmental responsibility.
“The partnership between Atlas AI and Airbus builds on Atlas AI’s global track record deploying GeoAI across industrial, energy, and infrastructure sectors. With end-consumer markets evolving rapidly and prone to macro forces that include production onshoring, COVID-19 and future pandemics, the threat of global conflict and climate-driven shocks, the urgency has never been greater to adopt AI-powered technologies to instill greater agility across global operations,” concludes Atlas AI CEO Abe Tarapani.“ Atlas AI is leading the charge to help these customers to anticipate and get ahead of significant market shifts and help build the supply chains that will thrive well into the future.”
Building on the initial success of this partnership, Atlas AI is now supporting new strategic programmes at Airbus, further solidifying the companies’ collaboration in advancing data-driven decision-making across the commercial aviation industry.
