AI is everything, everywhere and all at once.
It’s transforming industries at an unprecedented rate. The challenge for many businesses isn’t just how to adopt the technology, but what to do with the people it displaces.
IKEA, a global leader in home furnishings (and delicious meatballs), faced this dilemma when they introduced an AI chatbot to handle customer service. Billie, the AI bot, effectively managed 47% of customer inquiries.
But instead of cutting jobs, IKEA chose a different path, one that not only reskilled 8,500 employees but also generated a remarkable $1.4 billion in additional revenue.
This case study offers insights into how strategic reskilling, alongside AI adoption, can drive both business success and employee growth.
👓 Summary
IKEA set out to provide more value to its customers and support it’s employees with reskilling opportunities. It did so by giving new skills to 8,500 employees displaced by the introduction of a AI assistant, and making a nice $1.4 billion in profit for its efforts.
The challenge: Displaced by AI
Like many retailers, IKEA deals with a high volume of customer service queries.
To meet this demand more efficiently, they introduced an AI chatbot capable of handling routine customer inquiries. This AI solution quickly became a cost-effective tool, significantly reducing the need for human intervention.
Positive but also negative.
The decision to automate, however, posed a critical question: what would happen to the thousands of employees whose roles were now largely redundant?
Instead of following the path of least resistance and letting these employees go, IKEA created a different story. They realised that while the chatbot could handle basic queries, there were still numerous areas of the business where human skills and expertise were essential.
One of those in reviewing and improving the Chatbots answers, and others in new business areas.
How IKEA turned 8,500 Call Center Reps into Interior Design Advisors in under two years
IKEA’s answer to this challenge was a comprehensive reskilling initiative.
Rather than downsizing, the company retrained 8,500 employees for new roles in such as interior design consultants. Basically, an advisor helps you pick the items that would best compliment a room or previous orders.
These roles leveraged their existing customer service skills but added new layers of expertise that aligned with the company’s evolving business needs.
This is the point of the term “Reskilling”
What made IKEA’s approach particularly impactful was how they identified the gap between the employees’ current skills and the demands of the new roles.
Instead of starting from scratch, they built on the employees’ foundational customer service knowledge. Training programs focused on crafting specific customer interaction, design, and sales capabilities.
Others were up-skilled to handle more complex customer service tasks that required empathy, creative problem-solving, and expertise. The skills we know that AI can’t replicate.
The unexpected $1.4 Billion boost to IKEA sales
The results of IKEA’s reskilling efforts were remarkable.
Not only did the company avoid layoffs, but they also unlocked new revenue streams. By retraining employees to offer value-added services in interior design consultations, IKEA enhanced their customer experience and sales.
The financial impact was significant: the company reported an unexpected $1.4 billion in additional revenue.
This is a powerful reminder that technology and people don’t have to be in competition. When deployed thoughtfully, AI can free up human talent to focus on more strategic and revenue-generating tasks.
(Yes, read that line again over-eager CEO).
Why reskilling, not downsizing is the answer to AI adoption
Jobs being displaced by AI doesn’t mean the end.
It’s actually an opportunity craft new skills and deploy human resource where it is needed most in your business.
- Reskilling is a Strategic Advantage, Not a Cost
Ikea’s story demonstrates that reskilling isn’t just about retaining employees, it’s about positioning your business for growth.
Instead of viewing AI as a threat to jobs, IKEA saw it as an opportunity to redeploy human talent to higher value roles. For L&D professionals, this is a key lesson: your reskilling efforts should be aligned with the strategic goals of the business.
When done right, they can drive both employee engagement and financial performance. - AI and Human Skills Can Coexist
One of the biggest concerns surrounding AI adoption is the fear that it will replace human jobs.
IKEA’s approach shows that AI can complement human capabilities rather than replace them. While the chatbot took over routine customer service tasks, humans were freed up to take on more complex, creative, and customer-centric roles—areas where AI still falls short.
L&D teams should focus on identifying these complementary areas within their organisation’s. By fostering skills that enhance, rather than compete with, AI, companies can position themselves for long-term success. - Specific Reskilling Programs Drive Results
Ikea didn’t offer generic training to its employees.
They crafted targeted programs designed to address specific business needs. You can’t create any old generic experience and deem it “reskilling” L&D professionals can take a page from this book by designing training programs that bridge the gap between existing skills and the new demands brought on by AI and other emerging technologies.
The key is to recognise that reskilling doesn’t mean starting from zero. Many employees already have valuable foundational skills that can be built upon with focused training. - Invest in People, Reap Rewards
Perhaps the most important lesson from IKEA’s approach is the value of investing in people.
While AI may offer immediate cost savings, the long-term benefits of developing human talent can far outweigh those savings. IKEA’s reskilling initiative not only saved jobs but also turned a potential disruption into a revenue-generating opportunity.
For L&D professionals, this highlights the importance of advocating for reskilling and upskilling initiatives at the leadership level.
When employees feel valued and are given the opportunity to grow, the business benefits are clear.
Reskilling in the Age of AI
IKEA’s story illustrates a path forward for businesses grappling with the challenges of AI adoption.
Instead of viewing AI as a threat, companies can leverage it as a tool to drive innovation, while reskilling their workforce to meet new demands.
For L&D teams, the opportunity is clear: by leading reskilling efforts, they can help their organizations not only survive but thrive in the age of AI.
Ikea’s $1.4 billion result is proof that investing in people is not just a moral decision, it’s a strategic one.
