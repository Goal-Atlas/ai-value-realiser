Loop Earplugs, a Belgian company founded in 2016, designs stylish and innovative earplugs to enhance daily auditory comfort. Their flagship product is used by millions globally. Loop Earplugs was recognized by the Deloitte Fast 50 in 2022 as the fastest growing technology company.
Since its creation in 2016, Loop Earplugs has established itself as one of the most disruptive brands in the hearing protection market. Founded by two music enthusiasts, Maarten Bodewes and Dimitri O, the company was born from a simple observation: existing models were unaesthetic and poorly suited to contemporary uses. Initially, the brand mainly targeted concert and festival goers. The New York Times even called Loop the "best earplugs for concerts." Then Covid reshuffled the deck: the brand made a strategic shift to appeal to a wider user base, from remote workers seeking silence to neurodivergent people. Today, with 15,275% growth since 2018 hailed by the Deloitte Fast 50, the Belgian company is achieving global success. To support this hypergrowth, Loop Earplugs refined its marketing expertise. Historically very effective in static advertising, it quickly understood that it had to adopt a different approach to continue its progress. "If you want to target a whole new audience, you can't come directly with conversion ads. You have to gradually bring people towards the brand through storytelling," explains Vince Buyssens, Senior Creative Technologist at Loop Earplugs.
This logic led the company to invest in more narrative, "Above the Line" (ATL) video content, broadcast in 15 to 30 seconds. Premium formats are very effective for awareness, but at a prohibitive cost: "Producing an ATL video costs between 60,000 and 70,000 euros, because you need a team, actors, a script, etc.," recalls Vince Buyssens. With such budgets and lead times of several weeks, it was impossible to multiply creative tests. "But generative AI changes the game," continues Vince Buyssens. "By drastically lowering the entry barriers, this technology offers the possibility of testing new markets or multiple narrative angles with unprecedented agility, without committing astronomical sums." To realize this new approach, the company turned to Google Cloud. "Loop Earplugs is a very fast, very creative brand. To maintain this pace, we need partners who move at the same speed. Google Cloud gives us the level of responsiveness and innovation we need, particularly in the field of AI," summarizes Vince Buyssens.
Thanks to this partnership, Loop Earplugs was able to pre-test a unique technological combination of models: Veo 3 for video generation, and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) for image generation. "The complementarity of these two models was decisive because it allows us to create a workflow that reproduces a traditional shooting process... much faster and much cheaper," says Vince Buyssens. First Gemini Flash Image (Nano Banana) to create the right visuals, ensuring consistency, and then Veo 3 to bring them to life. In other words, this duo solves the major challenge of video AI: coherence. Where Veo generates realistic cinematic scenes, Gemini Flash Image ensures continuity, making it possible to isolate a character and transpose them into different settings without altering their features. "Creating a beautiful image with AI is easy. But keeping the same character, with the same features, from one scene to the next, was almost impossible before," explains Vince Buyssens. "By combining the functionalities of the two models, we can isolate a subject, actor, or product, and transpose them into different settings or lighting without ever altering their visual identity. In other words, the combination of Veo and Gemini Flash Image allows for the creation of a stable, reliable, and creative production flow."
The operational impact of this new approach was immediate. The first film generated with AI took three weeks, the time for the teams to learn to "think with" the models and adjust their working method. This agility is accompanied by formidable economic efficiency: the production cost fell to around 15,000 euros, a saving of 79%. "For large companies, this is a definite advantage. But for small brands, it's a revolution: they can now produce premium videos that were previously inaccessible to them," emphasizes Vince Buyssens. This new approach to video production also quickly translated into a clear improvement in marketing performance. Broadcast on YouTube, these AI-generated campaigns recorded a completion rate of nearly 95% on long formats and up to 98% on fifteen-second versions.
"When the aesthetics are mastered and the narration captures attention, AI is not a barrier: on the contrary, it reveals all the creative potential," analyzes Vince Buyssens. "In other words, AI is a multiplier: it doesn't replace human imagination, it multiplies it tenfold."
Loop sees these advances as a first step. "With the arrival of multimodal models and 'world models' developed by Google, such as Genie, we will cross a new threshold. These technologies will make it possible to create not only videos, but complete environments, true immersive experiences," explains Vince Buyssens. These models, capable of understanding and generating coherent spaces with their volumes, depth, and internal logic, pave the way for more immersive campaigns, where a brand could imagine true narrative universes rather than a simple succession of shots. And because these innovations are part of the Google Cloud ecosystem, they integrate naturally into the workflow already used by the company. It can therefore anticipate this evolution today. "Veo 3 and Gemini Flash have truly been game-changers. With these models, we feel like we are creating with a creative intelligence rather than a simple piece of software. This allows us to go further, faster, to test and dare things we never could have imagined before," concludes Vince Buyssens.
