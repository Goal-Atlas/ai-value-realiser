# 3D-Printed Rocket Manufacturing

## Executive Summary

Relativity Space: 85% of Terran 1 rocket fabricated using 3D printing.

## Key Findings

- **85% of Terran 1 rocket fabricated using 3D printing** — verified (outcome)
  - Quote: "Most rockets today rely on some 3D-printed parts, but 85% of Relativity's Terran 1 rocket is fabricated with this process."

- **Rocket production time reduced to 60 days** — verified (outcome)
  - Quote: "The company manufacture its rockets with its Stargate printers, which can help build a rocket from raw materials to flight readiness in about 60 days."

- **Parts count reduced from 3,000 to under 1,000** — needs_review (outcome)
  - Quote: "We target under 1,000 parts for our rockets. For example, the engine you saw has just three parts on it where traditionally that can have 3,000 parts, and all of that is due to the printing."

- **Engine parts reduced from 3,000 to 3 components** — verified (outcome)
  - Quote: "the engine you saw has just three parts on it where traditionally that can have 3,000 parts, and all of that is due to the printing, and that all leads into that cost and lead time reduction."

- **$1.65 billion in launch contracts secured** — verified (outcome)
  - Quote: "About $1.65 billion in launch contracts are already on the startup's books."

- **$1.3 billion raised in investment funding** — verified (outcome)
  - Quote: "Since then, Relativity has raised over $1.3 billion in investment funding with Pitchbook estimating the company's valuation at over $4 billion."

- **Terran 1 successfully passed Max Q structural test** — needs_review (method)
  - Quote: "The rocket did successfully achieve that milestone on Wednesday... the rocket actually met its goal for this test, which was to go past max Q—the place in a launch where the rocket is under maximum dy..."

- **Terran R payload capacity 16x greater than Terran 1** — verified (method)
  - Quote: "The larger Terran R rocket is expected to have the capacity to launch about 44,000 pounds (20,000 kilograms) — or 16 times more mass than what Terran 1 can manage — to low-Earth orbit."
