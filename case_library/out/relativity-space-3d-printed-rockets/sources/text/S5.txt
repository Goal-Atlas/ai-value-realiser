CAPE CANAVERAL SPACE FORCE STATION — Relativity Space has started the flight production of its new medium-to-heavy lift, reusable, 3D-printed Terran R rocket.
What You Need To Know
- Construction is underway at Launch Complex 16 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base
- Relativity Space announced a change in direction, to focus on the design, development, and production of the new Terran R launch vehicle
In March 2023, the company launched Terran 1 on its inaugural flight to test the structural capabilities of a 3D-printed rocket. Although the mission failed to reach orbit due to a second-stage engine issue, Relativity Space deemed the flight a success, demonstrating that the rocket’s 3D-printed materials could withstand the intense atmospheric pressures during launch.
One month after the Terran 1 launch, Relativity Space announced a change in direction, focusing on the design, development, and production of the new Terran R launch vehicle.
The company aimed to apply lessons learned from the Terran 1 test flight to meet customer demand for disruptive, diversified launch capabilities in an underserved and rapidly growing payload market.
The Terran R stands 284 feet (86.6 meters) tall with a 17.7-foot (5.4-meter) diameter payload fairing. Its design serves both commercial and government customers by delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit (LEO), medium-Earth orbit (MEO), and geostationary orbit (GEO). The rocket’s first stage will be fully reusable, with planned landings on a drone ship positioned downrange from the launch site.
Construction is underway at Launch Complex 16 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base, which includes laying new foundations, installing piles, and pouring concrete for the Terran R launch pad and supporting facilities. The rocket will make its inaugural flight in 2026.
