As the workplace continues to evolve, organizations face the challenge of balancing innovation with a human-centered approach to talent management. Korn Ferry’s 2025 Talent Trends report highlights the growing need for solutions that address pressing issues such as global collaboration, leadership development, and equitable workforce engagement. Meeting these demands requires tools that go beyond adapting to change—they must empower organizations to unlock potential at scale.
This quarter, we’re excited to unveil our latest updates to the Korn Ferry Talent Suite. These advancements reaffirm our commitment to enhancing the employee experience and enabling organizations to build resilient, high-performing teams.
Thoughtfully crafted to address critical talent needs, each enhancement in this release ensures your organization has the tools it needs to thrive in 2025 and beyond. Here’s a closer look at the highlights:
We’ve introduced updates that make talent solutions more relatable and accessible to diverse teams. Dynamic Feedback now supports Portuguese, marking our first steps toward enabling global teams to engage in their preferred language, while customizable avatars make feedback experiences more approachable and allow clients to represent their culture. These changes foster stronger connections and inclusivity, helping organizations manage talent effectively across regions and cultures.
Leveraging the latest in AI technology, we’ve improved decision-making and efficiency across talent solutions. From advanced AI models in Korn Ferry Pay, which enhance global applicability and precision, to flexible AI-powered job auto-matching in Profile Manager, this release continues to empower our customers to surface the jobs, skills, and benchmarks they need, when they need them, from Korn Ferry’s rich IP.
With automation and strategic partnerships at the forefront, we’re introducing new efficiencies to your talent processes. Profile Manager integrations with both SAP SuccessFactors and Workday represent an exciting milestone in enabling customers to dynamically align talent priorities to strategic goals, hire the right talent for the right roles, and prepare to tackle the future of work head-on. Korn Ferry Architect's automation updates further save valuable time and manual work, improving accuracy in job leveling and compensation analysis.
Our commitment to scalable growth is reflected in updates to Korn Ferry Learn and Coach. New courses on data analysis, including “Fundamentals of Data Analysis with AI,” bring timely skills to learners, while optimized group feedback programs in Korn Ferry Coach ensure leaders receive tailored insights to drive impactful change.
The new Engaged Performance Framework™ in Korn Ferry Listen introduces a comprehensive methodology for employee experience programs. By aligning strategic insights with business outcomes, this framework positions organizations to achieve a deeper understanding of and draw powerful connections between engagement and performance. Additionally, our enhanced collaboration with Salesforce in Korn Ferry Sell delivers smarter tools for sales teams, like Sales Programs, helping teams ramp-up faster, optimize interaction, and qualify opportunities more effectively.
