Skip to main contentYou're spending millions on AI. You're testing tools, launching experiments, running pilots—but still can't see any ROI.
The issue isn’t AI. It’s everything around it. Most companies treat AI like a technology problem when it's really an organizational one.
You need leaders at all levels who know how to guide through an AI transformation, workflows and systems designed for human + AI collaboration, and a culture that's ready for this rapid shift.
Get those elements right, and you unlock what neither humans nor AI can do alone.
Humans bring judgment and creativity. AI brings speed and scale. Together, they create value in ways that weren't possible before.
Leaders set the tone for everything. If they’re unsure about AI, everyone else will be too.
AI-ready leaders bring confidence and clarity from the start. They move fast but not recklessly, and they look beyond short pilots to build impact that lasts. And when the AI transformation gets difficult, with expected and unexpected twists, AI-ready leaders are the anchor that holds the vision steady.
That means learning, unlearning, and making space for their teams to do the same. When leaders show this kind of openness, they accelerate human-AI transformation in ways technology alone never could.
An AI-ready workforce is one where teams have the skills and tools to use AI in their daily work. They understand how it removes friction and speeds up work, and they know when human judgment should lead.
Culture makes the difference. In these workplaces, people feel safe experimenting and asking questions without worrying about getting it wrong. When curiosity is encouraged, AI becomes something teams use together, not something imposed on them.
“At the heart of every AI-ready workplace is the human + AI partnership—people and technology learning and achieving together.”
Bryan Ackermann, Head of AI Strategy & Transformation, Korn Ferry
Organizations don’t become AI-ready by accident. It starts with how work is designed—how jobs are structured, roles are shaped, decisions are made, and where people and technology come together.
With the right systems and the data behind them, AI scales naturally across the organization. Get the design right, and AI becomes part of how the business runs. Get it wrong, and even the best technology sits unused.
“The real ‘aha’ moment is that AI isn’t just a tool for doing the same work faster. It’s a way to transform work itself.”
Shanda Mints, VP, AI Strategy & Transformation, Korn Ferry
AI is reshaping how companies hire. As a copilot for recruiters, it scans resumes in seconds, surfaces stronger matches, and helps reduce bias. The result is faster hiring and a better experience for both candidates and teams.
But technology is only half the story. The real impact comes when AI and people work together. Data can point to the right skills, but human judgment reveals who will truly thrive in your culture.
Organizations using AI in hiring see 30% faster time-to-shortlist and 2–3 times higher win rates on complex searches.
