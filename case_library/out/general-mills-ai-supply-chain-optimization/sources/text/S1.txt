Dive Insight:
Even as businesses pour millions of dollars into AI initiatives, leaders hope the costly technology will end up saving their business money.
Generative AI got a bad reputation last year for its elusive returns, but most businesses didn't deprioritize the technology despite disillusionment. Among businesses that have yet to reach ROI on AI initiatives, the majority still expect cost savings to occur within three years, according to an IBM report.
The focus on cost-savings extends across industries.
Toymaker Mattel highlighted its AI initiatives as part of a broader cost-savings initiative during an earnings call last year. Financial services company Charles Schwab also credited AI use with driving down costs during a January earnings call.
Trimming costs and unlocking efficiencies can also drive revenue growth, leaders hope. Household product maker Colgate-Palmolive said it was using AI in revenue growth management practices to avoid unnecessary costs and bolster top-line growth during a conference in September. JPMorgan Chase executives estimated the company’s AI use cases will deliver around $2 billion in value during a September conference.
“Either we’ll be able to process a lot more for the same money or spend less,” President and COO Daniel Pinto said.
AI costs are also beginning to slide, a welcomed trend for enterprises. Accenture identified a 74% annual cost decline between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo from December 2021 to December 2024. Existing cost structures were especially put under the microscope following the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model.
Still, AI skepticism isn't unwarranted, even with early signs of enterprise success.
Most technology decision-makers are dealing with a laundry list of adoption barriers. More than 90% of leaders expressed concern about generative AI pilots proceeding without addressing problems uncovered by previous initiatives, according to Informatica. Leaders also admitted to feeling pressure to move projects along faster.
