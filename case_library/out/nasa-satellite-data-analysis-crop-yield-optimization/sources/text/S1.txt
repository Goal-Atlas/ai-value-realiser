Croplands cover over half of India's land area, and the agricultural sector employs about 590 million people in the country. Researchers can’t rely on census data alone to monitor agriculture in India because many farms are small (less than 2 hectares), whereas censuses typically report statistics at the state or national level and mask important heterogeneity. Remote sensing provides an essential vantage point for monitoring agriculture in India and investigating ways to sustainably improve crop yields.
Dr. Meha Jain, assistant professor in the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan, uses remote sensing to research agriculture in India. Jain has used a number of remote sensing instruments to better understand agricultural productivity at the farm level. Her more recent work has uncovered a method to use remote sensing to improve crop yields on poor-performing fields.
