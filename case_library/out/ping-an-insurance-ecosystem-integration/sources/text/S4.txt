What is an InsurTech Ecosystem?
An InsurTech ecosystem is a concept that’s designed to create a suitable environment for numerous insurance service providers so users can access more robust offerings.
The InsurTech ecosystem from experience has four main attributes. These are:
For a better understanding of the ecosystem, we’ll discuss some noteworthy examples.
Three InsurTech Ecosystem Examples
Ecosystems help introduce business models like API-based insurance and microservices. They’re also vital to helping consumers get personalized insurance services. Let’s discuss three ecosystems in this niche:
1. Ping An Insurance
Ping An Insurance of China is an ideal example of an InsurTech ecosystem. Through Innovation, it sells insurance services, and also provides other ads-on like Good Doctor, a care service.
Another service it offers is Pinganfang, a real estate service, and AutoHome which organizes recreational activities.
2. BNP Paribas Cardif
Cardif Insurance is another typical example of an InsurTech ecosystem. The company works primarily in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, to provide insurance services.
Beyond insurance, they also offer other financial services like real estate credit, personal investment, and other consumer-friendly services.
3. Discovery
A South African insurer named Discovery Insurance offers its consumers an ecosystem that entails life, car, and home coverage, together with medical aid and other financial services.
By creating an ecosystem, discovery noted that its consumer base has gained significantly. For example, its health and wellness program users have 28% fewer hospital stays.
This improved its profit margin. This shows that ecosystems are beneficial to insurance businesses.
Let’s discuss more the benefits of the insurance ecosystem.
Opportunities Created by the Insurance Ecosystem
The InsurTech ecosystem opens up a number of opportunities for every business to help make your InsurTech idea stand out. Below are some benefits:
1. Unlimited Startup Scaling Potential
The InsurTech market is expected to be worth 114 billion by 2030 as it’s currently growing at 46.1% between 2022 and 2030. This shows that the growth potential is strong, and startups can benefit from this by plugging themselves into or creating an ecosystem.
One startup benefiting from this opportunity is Alipay Insurance. The Insurtech service usage gained over 5 million new users the month it launched the Alipay super app.
2. Introduction of New Products
One great benefit of InsurTech ecosystems is that they help to introduce new brands of products to an existing customer base. For example, Lemonade Insurance currently helps Uber with its product users’ rental insurance.
This provides Lemonade with a straightforward market for Uber’s 131 million app users.
3. Creation of New Revenue Streams
Ecosystems help to create new profit streams. A study conducted by Sopheon shows that adding more services to an ecosystem adds to your revenue.
For example, Curacel, an AI-powered system for claims processing was able to seamlessly introduce its embedded insurance service to consumers within its ecosystem. Through this, it has been able to raise its revenue by 20%.
4. Cross-Application Data Exchange
Cross-application data exchange, the transfer of information between platforms within the same ecosystem plays a pivotal role for insurance companies, especially for Insurance companies leveraging generative AI.
Since ecosystems have multiple platforms that are accessed via a single one, the host determines what data is shared.
This ensures that all products get the needed data to guarantee personalized features.
For example, information from the Uber app is exchanged with Lemonade insurance, as they work together.
Another example is Lyft. It shares data with GrubHub, the insurance service in its ecosystem. This enables Grubhub users to get personalized insurance services.
Let’s discuss ways this can benefit your startup.
How to Leverage the Ecosystem Approach to Build a Startup
The Insurtech ecosystem offers multiple benefits. It provides startups opportunities to scale their products. Startups can either scale by using their internal resources or leveraging on others.
Let’s discuss these points!
Scale Using Your InsurTech Startup’s Resources
You can use your startup’s resources to scale your insurance product within an ecosystem. Statistically, this is the preferred method for 77% of organizations.
If you’re interested in using this popular route, ways to do that include
1. Fundraise and Create a New Insurance Product
The demand for InsurTech products is infinite. How? The global InsurTech market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 46.10% from 2021 to 2030. Also, health insurance alone is expected to reach $31 billion by 2030.
By creating an InsurTech product, you stand a chance to benefit from that growth.
On the fundraising side, VCs have shown interest in funding InsurTechsolutions, and statistics are showing that. One such is that the number of InsurTech funding deals increased by 21% from 2021 to 2022.
Also worthy of note is that VCs around the globe raised a total of $10.5 billion within the first 10 months of 2021.
Thus, there’s enough demand for insurance technology, and VCs are ready to back them. A sure way to get started is by creating your own insurance application. Learn more about insurance app development services.

2. Re-use Data within your Reach
A great way to have a leap start is via adopting data from one application within your ecosystem and reusing it in your InsurTech product.
For example: although Gmail was launched in 2008, it had 1.5 billion users in 2009.
This quick growth happened because it shares an ecosystem with Android and Google, enabling it to grow by reusing data from both platforms.
3. Scale your Services
Adding more services to your ecosystem helps you benefit from this approach. For example, a delivery insurance solution in an e-commerce app can significantly increase consumers.
Alipay’s consumer base increased from about 451 million users in 2016 to more than 1.3 billion users in 2023. Simply by scaling their services to include new features and products.

Scale Through a Partner Product
An effective way to accelerate growth is by including third-party solutions. It does this by improving your market credibility.
It’s estimated that over 57% of companies acquire customers via partnership. Another study highlights that nearly half of startups get insights and ideas from third parties.
The statistics above provide proof that partnership is an effective growth strategy. However, it’s important to vet third-party companies and products. Also, watch out for regulatory laws.
Ensure your partnership is complementary. For example, if your startup offers home insurance, then partnering with a mortgage loan provider is great.
