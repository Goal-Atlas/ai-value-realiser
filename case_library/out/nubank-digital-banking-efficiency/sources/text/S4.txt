Until recently, most banks and financial organizations treated artificial intelligence in banking as tomorrow’s experiment. That changed in 2024—the year financial AI stopped being a side project and became the engine of digital banking. Super-charged by breakthroughs in generative models and an investment rush, financial institutions everywhere began weaving AI into customer and employee touchpoints. The shift was dramatic: global AI adoption rocketed to 78% of all organizations—up from just 20% in 2017—while an extraordinary 91% of bank boards formally approved Gen-AI programs, according to NTT and McKinsey. The payoff is already visible in richer digital experiences, sharper personalization and faster, safer service. In other words, while banking’s AI journey may be in its early chapters, chapter one has opened with a bang.
In banking, AI is no longer experimental—it became a cornerstone of strategy for improving how customers engage with their banks online and via mobile. Within this article, we analyze how financial AI adoption in recent years impacted key areas of digital CX, highlighting global trends as well as specific insights from major markets like the US and UK. We examine both quantitative gains— such as higher customer satisfaction scores, rising self-service usage and digital adoption rates—and qualitative developments, including more personalized services, smarter virtual assistants and greater accessibility in digital banking.
Overall, banks that deployed AI at scale reported significant improvements in digital channel usage and customer feedback. For example, Bank of America (US) announced its clients reached 26 billion digital interactions in 2024 (a 12% year-over-year increase), including 676 million interactions with its AI virtual assistant “Erica.” In the UK, NatWest’s AI assistant, “Cora,” handled 11.2 million customer conversations in 2024, roughly equal to all interactions handled by the bank’s call centers and branches.
These examples illustrate the global trend: AI is enabling higher engagement on digital platforms and scaling up customer support without sacrificing quality. At the same time, a J.D. Power survey shows consumers are largely optimistic about AI’s benefits: 72% agree AI will deliver easy, convenient self-service but also highlight areas to improve, such as building trust and ensuring human-like empathy in AI interactions. In the sections below, we break down the impact by five key areas of customer experience: personalization, self-service, customer engagement, support automation and accessibility.
Market Impact: Banking Industry Leads in AI Adoption
A McKinsey survey indicates that AI adoption is now mainstream across industries. Overall, about 78% of organizations worldwide report using some form of AI in at least one business function in 2024, a huge increase from just 20% in 2017. Within this landscape, banking/financial services is a leading adopter of AI.
IDC estimates the banking industry will invest about $31.3 billion in financial AI, making it the second-largest industry for AI spending (after software/IT services at $33 billion and ahead of retail at approximately $25 billion). Together, software, banking and retail account for 38% of the global AI spend.
The years 2023–2024 saw an explosion of interest in generative AI (GenAI)—AI that can produce human-like text, code, images, etc. And banking has been at the forefront of deploying generative AI compared to other sectors.
GenAI Seduced Wall Street
Globally, generative AI usage by companies surged over the past year. 71% of organizations reported using generative AI regularly in at least one business function, according to a McKinsey Global AI Survey. This suggests that across all industries, a majority have begun experimenting with or deploying GenAI.
However, financial services firms are among the heaviest adopters. In a cross-industry survey by SAS, banking and insurance executives reported the highest current usage of generative AI—60% in each sector are already using GenAI in some capacity, the top rate among industries. Banking was singled out as leading all industries in GenAI integration, with the most use cases deployed per organization (on average).
Almost every bank is at least planning for GenAI. A global survey found that 98% of banking leaders either use generative AI now (60%) or plan to within two years (38%). This virtually unanimous interest is unique—other sectors showed lower current usage and more hesitancy. Banks also back up these plans with resources: 90% of banks surveyed have a dedicated GenAI budget for the coming year, indicating significant investment in AI talent and tools.
First-Mover Advantage: Banking’s AI Head-Start
Banking (often grouped with finance/insurance) figures prominently among the industries with the highest AI adoption. Research by IBM found that about 50% of enterprises in financial services have actively deployed AI, the highest of any sector. By comparison, the next-highest was telecommunications, at 37%, with other sectors generally lower.
Research from Boston Consulting Group likewise shows 35% of banking companies qualify as financial AI “leaders” (having scaled AI with high impact), a proportion surpassed only by fintech (49%) and software/IT firms (46%)
While detailed GenAI adoption rates for every industry vary by study, indicators show sectors like technology, finance and insurance are ahead of others like manufacturing or government in GenAI experimentation. For instance, a 2024 Statista study noted generative AI usage in financial services jumped to 52% of firms actively using it (up significantly from 2023).
Another survey of AI-savvy firms found that industries that underwent early digital disruption (e.g. finance, tech) have been quicker to adopt GenAI as well. A recent survey from SAS underscores that financial institutions lead in integrating AI into operations. The study found nearly 98% of banks (and insurers) either already use or plan to use generative AI in the near term—the highest among industries.
In contrast, sectors like healthcare and manufacturing show more cautious adoption. For example, based on a McKinsey survey in healthcare found that 85% of healthcare leaders reported their organizations were exploring or had already adopted generative AI capabilities, with 15% not yet having started to develop proofs of concept. This indicates significant interest in the sector.
Overall, banking’s head start in digital transformation has given it an edge in AI implementation, with analysts noting it is “leading other industries” in realized AI use cases. In contrast, heavily regulated or traditionally offline sectors are moving more cautiously. That said, even sectors such as healthcare and retail are rapidly exploring GenAI for their use cases (e.g. clinical decision support in healthcare, and AI-assisted marketing content in retail).
Proof in the Profits
Banks report concrete gains from GenAI deployments, more so than many peers in other industries. In banking, early adopters say GenAI is already improving employee productivity and customer experience.
For example, among banks that have implemented GenAI, 88% have seen improvements in risk management and compliance, and 85% report time/cost savings. These are significant positive outcomes.
Banks also use GenAI in diverse departments: marketing is the most common area (47% of banks use GenAI there), followed by IT (39%), sales (36%), finance (35%) and customer service (24%)—all higher rates than cross-industry averages.
Few other sectors have GenAI permeating so widely across functions. This broad applicability in banking (from automating fraud reviews to generating customer communications) underscores how financial firms are integrating GenAI into their core workflows more aggressively than most.
Beyond Fraud: Use Cases Expands
Banks initially applied AI in areas like fraud detection, risk management and credit analytics—core operations in which financial AI could immediately reduce losses and improve decisions. Indeed, 64% of finance leaders report using AI for fraud detection and risk management in their institutions.
These risk-oriented uses remain vital, but as AI capabilities have matured, banks are expanding into customer-facing and efficiency-driven applications. According to a 2024 banking technology report, chatbots/virtual assistants and personalized marketing are now seen as the AI use cases with the greatest future value in banking (cited by 87% and 83% of surveyed banks, respectively), alongside back-office automation (74%).
Traditional areas like fraud prevention (65%), credit underwriting (62%) and regulatory compliance (58%) are still heavily prioritized, reflecting that these were some of the first uses of artificial intelligence in banking and continue to be critical for reducing losses.
In summary, banks today leverage AI across a wide range of functions: from customer service chatbots to algorithmic trading, but they lead particularly in risk, fraud and personalization use cases.
Global Heat-Map: Where AI Burns Brightest
AI adoption—including generative AI—varies significantly by country and region. Generally, countries in Asia and the Middle East are reporting the highest rates of business AI adoption, often outpacing Western nations in early experimentation. Key statistics include:
Leading Countries (Enterprise AI)
According to IBM’s 2023 Global AI Index, India has the highest level of AI usage among enterprises. About 59% of organizations in India were actively using AI, closely followed by the United Arab Emirates (58%), Singapore (53%) and China (50%).
These countries have invested heavily in AI and show a strong cultural receptiveness to new tech. In contrast, many Western economies have a smaller share of companies actively deploying AI: e.g. Australia (~29%), Spain (~28%), and France (~26%) were among the lower rates.
The United States and UK fall in the middle range. Roughly one-third of businesses in the US are actively using AI (U.S. firms “fall between 30% and 40%” active use), and the UK is similar, with the majority exploring but not as many fully deployed yet.
Generative AI in the Workforce
When looking at individual usage of generative AI, emerging markets also lead. In a late 2023 Salesforce survey of general populations in major countries, India had the highest generative AI usage—73% of surveyed Indians said they use generative AI in some form.
Other countries had lower, though still substantial, usage: in Australia 49% of adults were using genAI, in the U.S. 45%, while the UK was at 29% usage. This illustrates a trend in which India and other middle-income countries have embraced genAI tools fastest, possibly due to leapfrogging behaviors and enthusiasm for new tech.
Developed countries like the US and UK have large numbers of users as well, but also a greater share of non-users or cautious adopters.
Policy and Adoption
It’s worth noting that national policy and data availability also influence genAI adoption. For example, Europe’s stricter regulatory environment (e.g., GDPR, upcoming AI Act) can slow down deployment of generative models in EU countries compared to the relatively laissez-faire approach in the U.S. and China.
Meanwhile, countries like UAE have national AI strategies and even government services powered by generative AI, thus boosting adoption. China saw a boom in domestic generative AI models in 2023, with many companies adopting local versions (due to restrictions on Western models), contributing to high usage rates within Chinese enterprises as well.
U.S. Banks Bet Big: GenAI Pioneers
In the United States, the banking sector has dramatically ramped up its focus on financial AI in the past year, especially generative AI. 2024 has been a pivotal year for AI in U.S. banking, with nearly all major banks announcing AI initiatives or investments. Key U.S.-specific insights include:
High Adoption Rates
Surveys of U.S. financial institutions show the vast majority are already using AI or plan to imminently. A PYMNTS report in 2024 found 72% of finance leaders at banks say their departments utilize AI technologies in some form. Even regional and mid-sized banks have started deploying AI for automation and analytics.
Critically, bank leadership is on board—according to an Ernst & Young survey, “nearly every bank’s board now stamps ‘yes’ on generative AI” initiatives. In fact, 91% of bank boards have endorsed GenAI projects as of late 2023. This top-down support indicates that U.S. banks view generative AI as strategically important.
Use Cases and Impact
U.S. banks are applying AI in a range of use cases. On the risk and operations side, common uses include fraud detection, anti-money-laundering pattern detection, credit risk scoring and trading optimization. About 64% of U.S. finance leaders cite fraud and risk management as areas in which they use AI.
Automation of routine processes (like loan processing or compliance checks) is also significant (over half report using AI for automation). An EMarketer report suggests that on the customer-facing side, many U.S. banks introduced AI virtual assistants/chatbots in recent years (e.g., Bank of America’s Erica chatbot).
Generative AI now promises to make these bots more conversational and powerful. According to a late 2023 survey, 48% of U.S. bank executives plan to use generative AI to enhance customer-facing chatbots and virtual assistants, indicating a wave of next-gen AI chatbots in development. Banks are also exploring GenAI for personalized marketing (creating tailored financial advice content) and for software code generation to speed up development.
Investment Figures
The U.S. banking sector is rapidly ramping up investments in generative AI, signaling a transformative shift in financial services. According to McKinsey, generative AI could unlock between $200 billion and $340 billion annually for the global banking industry, with a substantial portion of that value expected to be captured by U.S. institutions given their scale and technological leadership.
Leading the charge is JPMorgan Chase, which has allocated a record-breaking $18 billion to technology spending for 2025, a significant portion of which will support AI initiatives. A significant share of this budget supports its proprietary generative AI platform, already used by over 200,000 employees and powering more than 100 AI-driven tools across business units. These tools are driving operational efficiencies, including a 30% reduction in servicing costs and a 10% decrease in headcount in some functions.
Such an aggressive investment trend reflects a broader recognition that generative AI is no longer a future bet—it’s a current imperative. With such figures, U.S. banks are positioning themselves to lead the next wave of AI-enabled innovation in global finance.
Notable Developments 2024
In 2024, U.S. banks pioneered from exploration to implementation of generative AI. A few highlights:
- JPMorgan launched a ChatGPT-like internal tool (“IndexGPT”) to assist wealth advisors with research.
- Morgan Stanley rolled out a GPT-4 powered assistant for its financial advisors (to query internal research databases).
- Goldman Sachs used generative AI to automate parts of its coding and document analysis, reporting significant productivity boosts.
- Regional banks and credit unions also started leveraging AI-as-a-service from cloud providers (e.g., using Microsoft Azure OpenAI service to build custom chatbots for customer service).
These initiatives illustrate the breadth of adoption—from Wall Street giants to smaller banks, generative AI became a key theme in 2024.
Challenges
U.S. banks face challenges in AI adoption, such as regulatory compliance and risk management. Banks must ensure AI models (especially GenAI, which can be a “black box”) do not violate fair lending laws or produce biased decisions.
Data privacy is also a concern. Banks handle sensitive customer data that cannot be simply fed into public AI models without safeguards. In 2024, U.S. regulators (like the OCC and Federal Reserve) increased scrutiny on banks’ use of AI, urging robust governance. Nonetheless, banks are addressing these by developing AI governance frameworks and using techniques like model explainability and data anonymization.
According to PYMNTS, 55% of U.S. banking leaders are optimistic about AI and already recognizing benefits, but a portion remain cautious, emphasizing the need for clear ROI and risk controls.
In summary, the U.S. financial sector in 2024 embraced generative artificial intelligence in banking at high rates. Virtually every major bank has financial AI pilot programs, with common use cases around fraud detection, chatbot customer service and credit risk analysis. The momentum is driven by both competitive pressure and clear early wins (e.g., cost reductions and improved customer engagement).
London Calling: The UK’s Gen AI Sprint
The United Kingdom’s banking and financial services sector is similarly pressing ahead with AI, with strong adoption seen in 2024. Surveys by regulators and industry groups show that AI usage is now widespread among UK banks, and generative AI is a top strategic priority.
Prevalence of AI
A joint Bank of England and FCA survey in 2024 found 75% of UK financial services firms are already using AI, up sharply from 58% in 2022. In banking specifically, adoption is even higher: nearly 94% of international banking institutions in the UK reported employing AI technologies in some capacity. This aligns with EY’s European FS AI Survey, which reported that 91% of UK financial firms have integrated AI into their operations to some degree.
In other words, virtually all major UK banks have started on their AI journey (only a small minority have not started at all). However, most are still in early or pilot stages rather than full maturity—EY noted only 5% of UK firms consider themselves “ahead of the curve” on AI and truly at scale.
Acceleration in 2024
The 2024 year saw a big jump in AI investment by UK banks. Lloyds Bank’s 2024 survey of financial institutions found AI adoption/usage in the UK financial sector “doubled to 63% in one year,” implying the share of firms implementing AI went from ~30% to 60%+ within a year.
Banking executives in the UK widely view AI as essential to competitiveness. 32% of UK’s financial firms said they accelerated AI adoption in the last year alone, as they race to realize efficiency gains, according to EY. Additionally, 82% of UK’s financial leaders plan to increase their investments in generative AI going forward, a strong signal of intent to scale projects beyond the pilot phase.
Generative AI Focus
Generative AI became a buzzword in UK banking circles in 2023–24, much as in the U.S. The Bank of England’s survey specifically added questions on GenAI for the first time, reflecting its rapid emergence. While quantitative adoption figures for GenAI in UK banks are still being gathered, anecdotal evidence and qualitative data show high interest:
- UK banks are exploring GenAI for similar use cases as U.S. banks, e.g., enhancing customer chatbots, automating code and document generation and improving fraud detection with AI that can analyze unstructured data.
- An EY UK survey noted GenAI is considered a top priority by UK financial execs, yet many feel their organizations are not fully prepared (77% admitted their workforce lacks strong GenAI skills). Only 27% of UK firms have rolled out GenAI training programs so far, indicating that banks recognize a skills gap as they adopt these tools.
- Collaborative industry efforts have started in the UK to harness GenAI. For instance, UK Finance (the industry trade body) released reports in late 2024 on “Generative AI in action,” encouraging banks to responsibly adopt GenAI and sharing best practices. This suggests UK banks are coordinating on how to implement GenAI within regulatory guardrails.
Use Cases and Early Benefits
UK banks mirror global trends in AI use cases. According to a BoE/FCA survey, the most common AI use cases already in deployment at UK firms included optimization of internal processes (41% of firms), cybersecurity enhancement (37%) and fraud detection (33%). These are areas in which UK banks have historically invested in analytics and are now augmenting with AI.
The expected benefits align with productivity and innovation. In a Lloyds survey, 32% of UK banks already noted productivity gains from AI, 22% cited a competitive edge, and 18% saw better insights for decision-making as a result of AI adoption. Furthermore, 69% of UK institutions expect even more benefits as they continue to innovate with AI.
Regulatory Environment
The UK’s regulators have been proactive in studying AI use in finance, which has helped clarify usage. The BoE/FCA reassures in their survey that regulators are monitoring AI’s impact and gathering data. While there are not yet AI-specific financial regulations in force, UK banks anticipate incoming rules. However, only 9% of UK bank executives felt their firm was well prepared for upcoming AI regulations. This has prompted industry calls for more guidance.
Meanwhile, data privacy and model transparency are top concerns in the UK (as they are elsewhere). A Statista poll in 2024 showed data security was the leading barrier to scaling GenAI in UK finance, cited by 33% of firms. UK banks are thus balancing innovation with caution, ensuring AI outputs are explainable and compliant. The upshot is that UK banks are moving fast on adoption, but with an eye on governance—an approach encouraged by regulators.
In summary, UK banks in 2024 have broadly embraced AI, with adoption rates comparable to the U.S. and global leaders. Nearly all major UK banks use AI for something, and many have ramped up investments in the past year, particularly in generative AI pilots. Fraud detection, compliance and customer service are prime areas of focus.
Executives in London’s financial hub view GenAI as a transformative opportunity to boost productivity: 82% plan to spend more on it, yet they are mindful of challenges like talent training and regulatory compliance. The UK banking sector’s next step is moving from experimentation to scaling these AI solutions enterprise-wide, a journey still moving forward in 2025.
Banking, Tailored: Personalized Banking Experiences
Financial AI turns one-size-fits-all into one-size-fits-one, driving double-digit revenue and CSAT jumps. Personalization emerged as a top priority for banks’ AI initiatives, driven by customer expectations for services tailored to their needs. According to a McKinsey study, 71% of consumers now expect personalized experiences from their banks, and 76% feel upset when personalization is lacking.
Banks responded by leveraging AI (including machine learning and predictive analytics) to analyze vast troves of customer data—from transaction histories to digital behavior—and deliver more individualized experiences.
In fact, a global marketing survey found personalization is the predominant use case for AI in finance, with 44% of organizations scaling AI to tailor customer experiences, anticipate needs and boost loyalty. This shift toward hyper-personalization is yielding tangible results: one analysis reported that using AI-driven insights for customer experience led to “double-digit boosts in revenue, customer satisfaction and campaign conversions” for financial institutions. In other words, AI isn’t just a gimmick; it’s translating into happier customers and improved business outcomes.
Banks around the world rolled out AI-powered personalization features in 2024. Many mobile banking apps started offering AI-generated insights and advice customized to each user’s financial situation. For example, some banks use AI to automatically notify customers of unusual spending, predict upcoming bills or suggest budget adjustments—all tailored to the individual. In the US, Wells Fargo began leveraging predictive analytics and generative AI for dynamic content creation, aiming to deliver “hyper-personalized interactions that drive engagement and revenue.”
Regional banks also saw success: First Horizon Bank’s marketing team integrated AI to predict client needs and personalize messages, reporting “promising results” in deepening customer relationships. Meanwhile, in the UK, both incumbents and digital challengers invested in personalization. Digital-only banks like Starling Bank and Revolut (which reached 52.5 million customers in 2024) built their growth in part on personalized financial tools, prompting incumbents to follow suit.
The demand is high: a large majority of banking customers (in all age groups) want more personalized experiences, and almost half are willing to let banks use their data for this purpose. This pushed banks in 2024 to use AI not only for targeted product offers, but also to tailor content, notifications and even the user interface to each customer’s profile.
Beyond marketing, AI-driven personalization extended to financial advice and planning. Some banks piloted virtual financial advisors that analyze a customer’s goals and spending patterns to offer bespoke advice—for example, suggesting how to save for a house or which debt to pay down first. While these AI advisors gained some traction, trust remained a hurdle for sensitive advice: a survey found only 27% of consumers fully trust AI for financial guidance. To address this, banks paired AI insights with human validation or made AI recommendations fully transparent.
The overall trajectory is clear: personalization became a must-have aspect of digital banking, and AI provided the engine to deliver it at scale. Banks that executed well saw improvements in customer loyalty, whereas those with generic one-size-fits-all digital experiences risked falling behind.
As Capgemini’s global head of data for financial services noted, “AI and generative AI are rapidly transforming how we view personalized banking experiences… enabling analysis of vast data to generate tailored content, recommendations and interactions,” which is proving “transformational” for customer engagement.
DIY Banking Takes Over: Rise of Self-Service
AI adoption in 2024 also turbocharged self-service capabilities in banking. Customers increasingly prefer to handle their banking needs digitally, without having to visit a branch or call a helpline for routine tasks. Banks used AI to make these self-service options smarter, more intuitive and more comprehensive than ever. The result was a continued climb in digital banking usage across markets.
A Cornerstone Advisors study showed digital banking users reached 77% of checking account customers in 2024, reflecting that digital adoption is at near-saturation among many demographics.
Even in markets with traditionally high branch usage, the trend is similar. In the UK, for instance, 87% of adults use online banking, and 60% use mobile banking as of 2024, according to UK Finance, and 40% of Brits in 2025 have an account with a digital-only bank—a number that has risen sharply in recent years. This mass migration to digital channels has been facilitated and accelerated by AI-driven enhancements to self-service.
One of the clearest impacts of AI is the proliferation of virtual assistants and chat interfaces that empower customers to get things done on their own. From simple tasks, like checking a balance or paying a bill, to more complex actions like applying for a loan, AI has made self-service more convenient. A survey by Zendesk noted that self-service adoption in financial services has grown 5.4× in recent times, as banks provide more useful tools like searchable knowledge bases and intelligent chatbots.
Customers appreciate these improvements: about 75% say self-service is a convenient way to address issues, and 67% actually prefer self-service over speaking to a human rep.
Especially for tech-savvy segments (millennials and Gen Z), digital banking is the default – 60% of millennials primarily use mobile banking apps as their main way to bank. In 2024, banks responded to this demand by expanding what customers can do without human intervention.
AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants played a dual role in boosting self-service. First, they act as 24/7 guides: an AI bot can understand a customer’s query in natural language and either provide the answer or walk the user through the steps to complete a task. Second, these bots leverage AI to handle multi-step requests that previously might have required an employee.
For example, Brazil’s Nubank (one of the largest digital banks) offers a self-service model in which customers can do “everything from paying a bill or raising their credit limit to setting travel notices” via the app. Over 80% of Nubank’s customers handle their needs through these digital self-service features without the need for additional support.
This kind of comprehensive self-service became a benchmark in 2024. In the US, Bank of America (BofA) expanded the capabilities of its virtual assistant, “Erica,” to allow in-app money transfers and more complex queries, further reducing the need to visit a branch or ATM. And at Wells Fargo, the new AI assistant, “Fargo,” was introduced to simplify everyday banking tasks in the mobile app, contributing to a staggering 245.4 million customer interactions via the assistant in its first year.
The convenience of AI-driven self-service translated into higher digital engagement and cost savings. Automated self-service options deflect routine inquiries that would otherwise flood call centers, freeing human staff to focus on high-value or complex cases.
Industry analysis estimated that bank chatbots will save around $7.3 billion globally in customer service costs, roughly $0.70 per interaction handled by AI instead of a human. Moreover, customers who get quick, effective answers on their own tend to be more satisfied. A survey by Zendesk in 2024 found 77% of consumers say AI is helpful for simple issues, indicating that when AI works, it meets customer expectations. However, it’s worth noting that AI self-service is not yet perfect.
The J.D. Power 2024 banking satisfaction study found that while overall satisfaction with big banks rose, the one area that saw a dip was when customers tried to contact the bank through self-service digital channels for help. This suggests that some banks’ self-service tools in 2024 still left a gap when customers had more detailed questions or problems. Banks are learning from this, enhancing their knowledge bases and making AI bots more context-aware so they can handle nuanced inquiries.
In summary, 2024 cemented self-service as an essential component of banking CX—largely enabled by AI—with customers embracing the flexibility to “do it yourself” and banks enjoying higher digital adoption rates as a result.
Next-Gen CX in Banking: Proactive Customer Engagement
Beyond enabling transactions, AI has transformed how banks engage and build relationships with customers through digital channels. In 2024, banks used AI to become more proactive, conversational and timely in customer interactions, rather than just reactive. This led to higher customer engagement, measured by increased logins, more frequent interactions and deeper usage of digital services.
A striking example comes from Bank of America, which reported that its clients logged into digital banking 14.3 billion times in 2024, and nearly 38 million customers subscribed to proactive digital alerts (up 7% from the prior year). Those alerts, powered by AI analysis of account activity, delivered nearly 12 billion personalized notifications in 2024, giving customers real-time insights into things like low balances or unusual charges.
This kind of AI-driven engagement keeps customers continuously connected with their finances and with the bank’s app. As a result, BofA saw users logging in on average more than once per day, and digital interactions overall jumped by double digits year-over-year.
A Forrester analyst noted that BofA’s mobile app “at least meets and often exceeds customers’ expectations” in most categories, thanks in part to useful features like these AI-powered alerts. The lesson echoed globally: when digital banking is helpful and personalized, customers engage with it frequently, creating a virtuous cycle of value for both the user and the bank.
AI also enabled conversational engagement through chat and messaging interfaces. In 2024, many banks rolled out or upgraded chat services (e.g., in-app chat, WhatsApp banking, etc.) in which AI would be the first to respond. This effectively turned customer service into a continuous, two-way dialogue.
For instance, NatWest (UK) saw its chatbot, Cora, manage millions of conversations that not only answered questions but also guided customers to relevant services. With the launch of Cora+ (a generative AI-enhanced version), NatWest’s assistant became even more engaging—able to converse more naturally about products and financial guidance, almost like a human agent. Early pilots suggest that these AI chats can handle complex queries with a more conversational tone, making customers feel heard and supported.
Similarly, banks in the US like Capital One expanded their AI chat capabilities. For example, Capital One’s Eno can proactively warn customers about suspected fraud or duplicate charges, engaging them in real-time via text message.
By analyzing customer data and context, AI allows banks to initiate contact at the right moment: sending a helpful tip, a security alert or a personalized offer exactly when it’s relevant. 70% of consumers value a consistent experience across channels, and AI helps achieve this by maintaining context across mobile apps, web and chat. A customer might start a task in a chatbot and finish in the app, or vice versa, with AI ensuring a seamless handoff. This omnichannel fluidity was a key engagement theme in 2024.
Major markets demonstrated the impact of AI on engagement through concrete metrics. In the U.S., banks that invested heavily in AI-driven CX saw higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and loyalty drivers. While overall NPS can depend on many factors, leading banks like Chase and Capital One (both noted for their advanced digital experiences) continued to rank at the top of customer satisfaction surveys. In the U.K., digital challengers dominated customer advocacy: Forrester’s 2024 survey of European banks found that app-centric banks, such as Starling Bank, earned the highest NPS in the UK market (beating even other fintechs by a few points).
From a qualitative standpoint, AI-powered engagement in 2024 meant banks could anticipate customer needs instead of waiting for customers to reach out. Predictive models identified which customers might be shopping for a home, need a savings boost or be at risk of overdraft—and then proactively offered assistance or deals. This not only drives sales; it also improves the customer’s financial health, thus building goodwill.
One survey noted that 62% of consumers would immediately try AI-driven personalized alerts to help avoid fees, showing that engagement efforts that clearly benefit the customer are warmly welcomed.
In summary, AI made digital banking more engaging in 2024 by turning it into an ongoing conversation—through alerts, chats and personalized content—rather than a static utility. Banks in the U.S. and UK that mastered this saw stronger customer loyalty and higher usage of their digital platforms, while globally the norm shifted toward AI-enabled “smart” engagement as a key to CX success.
AI Takes Care: Support at the Speed of Thought
Perhaps the most visible impact of artificial intelligence in banking has been in customer support automation. In 2024, nearly every major bank either launched or upgraded an AI-driven virtual assistant to handle customer inquiries, marking a significant shift in how service is delivered. These AI assistants (e.g., text-based chatbots and increasingly voice bots) became front-line support, capable of resolving many issues that used to require a phone call or branch visit.
The volume of inquiries handled by AI is staggering: by late 2024, it’s estimated that more than 987 million people worldwide use AI chatbots for various services, and banking is a leading sector in this trend. Banks like Bank of America reported that since launching the “Erica” chatbot a few years ago, it had facilitated over 2.5 billion interactions in total, with hundreds of millions in 2024 alone.
In the UK, NatWest’s Cora not only answered routine questions but also helped perform transactions, effectively handling workload equivalent to thousands of support agents. Cora handled 11.2 million retail banking conversations in 2024, matching the scale of their human-assisted contacts.
These examples underscore how AI automation scaled customer support to new levels, improving response times and availability. Customers can get help 24/7, in seconds, which is reflected in high satisfaction with these tools: a Capgemini study found 89% of customers were satisfied with generative AI virtual assistants, and 73% trust content written by AI, indicating growing confidence in automated support.
NatWest’s Cora+ was trained with safeguards (in partnership with IBM) to avoid the pitfalls of open AI models (like inaccurate “hallucinations” or bias), emphasizing trust and reliability in its answers. In the U.S., banks were more cautious but still active in exploring generative AI for support.
JPMorgan Chase, for example, invested in developing AI models (sometimes dubbed “IndexGPT”) for both customer service and investment advice, while Wells Fargo’s Fargo assistant used Google’s Dialogflow AI for robust understanding of customer requests. Even regional banks and credit unions began deploying AI chatbots through cloud providers or fintech partners, recognizing that automated support is becoming an expected part of digital banking.
The quantitative benefits of support automation are significant. AI assistants resolve a large portion of common inquiries—balance requests, card activation, password resets, loan rate questions, etc.—in a self-service manner. This has led to shorter wait times and faster issue resolution for customers. For example, one report highlighted that customer service teams using AI can scale productivity without adding headcount, deflecting repetitive inquiries and freeing human agents for more complex issues. This improved first-contact resolution rates and reduced call center volumes.
A Gartner study noted that 61% of banking executives planned to increase AI investments specifically to enhance areas like customer service in the coming year. In 2024’s AI strategy, leading banks integrated a seamless escalation to human agents when needed, often with AI assisting in the background by summarizing the issue for the agent. This human-in-the-loop approach ensured that while AI handles the heavy load, the human touch remains essential for sensitive matters.
Both the U.S. and UK saw case studies of improved support due to AI. BofA’s Erica not only answered questions but could perform actions (like bill pay or Zelle transfers via voice commands), and the bank attributed part of its high digital engagement to Erica’s success.
20 million BofA clients used Erica in 2024, and feedback has been positive enough that Erica’s capabilities keep expanding. In the UK, Lloyds Bank and HSBC also enhanced their AI chat assistants in 2024, with HSBC launching an AI-powered customer support chat on its mobile app to complement phone service (especially valuable as branch networks contract).
As a broader trend, a PYMNTS report noted only 12% of banks provided AI-powered customer service as of early 2024, but about half plan to implement it in the next months—signaling that support automation was a major focus industry-wide. Consumers increasingly embraced these AI helpers when well-implemented: one survey found 72% of retail banking customers actually prefer an “intelligent virtual assistant” over a standard chatbot, likely because the former provides a more accurate and conversational experience.
Further AI-driven support in banking will evolve from simple chatbots to more advanced virtual agents. This evolution will improve the speed, availability and consistency of customer service, thereby lifting overall customer satisfaction despite initial skepticism.
Inclusive by Design: Enhancing Accessibility
An often underappreciated aspect of artificial intelligence in banking is how it can improve accessibility and inclusivity of digital services. In 2024, banks began applying AI to ensure that digital banking works better for all customers, including those with disabilities or special needs.
Traditionally, accessibility in finance focused on accommodating visual or hearing impairments (e.g., screen reader compatibility or text-to-speech for phone banking). But 2024 brought a broader vision: banks started to tailor digital experiences for people with cognitive differences, mental health challenges, language barriers and more—areas in which AI’s adaptability is key. Accessibility and inclusivity are finally receiving greater attention across the banking sector, with advances in AI helping to drive this progress.
For instance, AI can detect when a customer is having difficulty navigating an app (through behavior patterns) and proactively offer simplified explanations or switch to a voice-assisted mode. AI-driven personalization also means interfaces can adjust to a user’s needs in real time.
Financial products should be designed for users with anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions in mind, not just physical disabilities, and AI can stitch together behavioral data across touchpoints to help banks understand and support each customer holistically. This represents a more compassionate use of AI: using data to identify when a customer might be financially stressed or confused and responding with empathy through the digital channel.
In practical terms, 2024 saw banks introduce features like AI-powered voice assistants for those who prefer speaking to navigating a screen. These go beyond basic IVR systems; they use natural language processing to carry out banking tasks via voice (useful for visually impaired customers or the elderly who find apps challenging).
Some banking apps added real-time transcription and translation services (AI translating speech or text on the fly), making services accessible to non-native speakers or customers with hearing impairments. For example, a customer could speak in one language and have the chatbot respond in another, bridging communication gaps.
Another development was AI-driven image recognition for bill payment or check depositing, simplifying processes for those who struggle with manual input, just snapping a photo and letting AI do the work. These kinds of features improved the overall usability of digital banking for a wider audience.
In the U.S., where regulatory focus on accessibility is growing, large banks worked to ensure their websites and apps meet ADA standards and WCAG guidelines, often using AI tools to test and fix accessibility issues (like adjusting color contrast or adding AI-generated descriptions for images). In the UK, banks collaborated with fintechs specializing in inclusive design—for instance, leveraging AI fintech solutions that help dyslexic users by changing fonts or reading out text.
The benefits of AI-driven accessibility enhancements are both social and commercial. They empower more customers to confidently use digital banking, which in turn increases digital adoption among groups that might have been left behind. A more accessible app can turn reluctant users into active digital customers, raising adoption rates. It also strengthens trust and loyalty: customers feel the bank cares about their individual needs. While quantitative metrics here are harder to measure, one can look at engagement from traditionally underserved segments.
Banks reported, for example, increased usage of mobile apps among senior customers after adding voice-command features and larger, adaptive text, indicating that AI features can bring in demographics that previously stuck to branches. Moreover, designing for extreme use cases often improves the experience for everyone (the curb-cut effect).
A Forrester study on CX drivers noted that feeling “valued” is a key loyalty driver, and providing accessible, inclusive digital services is a concrete way to show every customer they are valued.
In summary, 2024’s AI push in banking was not only about efficiency and personalization, but also about humanizing digital experiences and leaving no customer behind. From adjusting to a user’s pace (as simple as noticing if someone is scrolling slowly and might need extra help) to providing emotionally intelligent responses via chat, AI made digital banking more accommodating.
Both the U.S. and UK saw forward movement: U.S. banks like Citi invested in AI-driven document readers for visually impaired users, while UK banks such as Lloyds emphasized mental health–friendly banking apps with calming designs guided by AI feedback. These efforts, while still emerging, set the stage for a more inclusive digital banking landscape.

Conclusion: from Hype to Habit
Banks worldwide are leading the charge in AI adoption, leveraging the technology more extensively—and investing more heavily—than most other industries. By 2024, an overwhelming majority of banks have integrated AI into business functions—from back-office automation to customer-facing chatbots. This outpaces adoption in sectors such as manufacturing or healthcare, where AI use is growing but is not as ubiquitous.
The advent of generative AI over the past year has only widened this gap, with banks quick to pilot GenAI for improved customer service, risk management and operational efficiency. Globally, financial institutions in regions like North America, Europe and Asia are all onboard the AI trend, though uptake is fastest in countries like India, China and the UAE, and somewhat slower in others due to regulatory or cultural factors.
Both in the United States and the United Kingdom, 2024 can be seen as a breakthrough year for artificial intelligence in banking. Virtually every major bank in every major market is now either using generative AI or actively planning to use it. They are motivated by clear benefits: better fraud detection, cost reductions, personalized customer experiences and by competitive pressure as fintech players and “AI-native” firms disrupt traditional banking. Surveys show upwards of 90% of bank executives in the US and UK have greenlit AI projects or increased budgets for GenAI, demonstrating strong confidence in the technology.
Going forward, the banking sector is expected to continue investing aggressively in AI capabilities. Analysts project exponential growth in AI spending by banks (e.g., global generative AI spending in banking could reach ~$85 billion by 2030). Key use cases like fraud detection, chatbots, credit scoring and algorithmic trading will become further enhanced by advanced AI. Banks will also likely collaborate with regulators to develop frameworks for responsible AI (as seen in the UK’s surveys) and address challenges like bias and transparency. In sum, banking’s early embrace of AI—now turbocharged by generative AI—is positioning the sector for significant transformation in the years ahead, outpacing many other industries in the AI adoption curve.
2024 was a pivotal year for artificial intelligence in banking, as institutions worldwide moved from pilot projects to real deployments that tangibly improved the digital customer experience. Globally, banks observed that AI could boost both customer satisfaction and operational performance—a true win-win. By automating routine tasks and augmenting human employees, AI allowed banks to serve more customers with greater consistency.
Quantitatively, we saw metrics trend in the right direction: higher Net Promoter Scores in markets in which digital CX was strong, record digital adoption rates (with active digital users exceeding 75%–80% at many banks) and significant increases in self-service transactions and chatbot interaction counts. One Capgemini study even linked AI-driven CX improvements to double-digit gains in satisfaction and revenue, underscoring the financial payoff of more satisfied customers. Qualitatively, customers in 2024 enjoyed more personalized, convenient and engaging banking services than ever before—from receiving tailored financial advice in-app to getting instant help from a friendly AI assistant at midnight. Use cases like generative AI chatbots went from novelty to mainstream, with major banks in the US and UK launching or refining such tools.
Of course, the transition was not without challenges. Banks had to address customer trust and security concerns around AI. Surveys revealed that while people welcomed convenience, many remained cautious about AI handling their finances: over 57% of customers hesitated to use AI-generated financial advice, and a minority outright refused to use AI for banking tasks. Incidents of AI errors (or “hallucinations”) were taken seriously, and institutions implemented guardrails and testing to maintain accuracy.
The human element also proved vital—leading banks found the best outcomes by combining AI efficiency with human empathy, ensuring that customers could seamlessly escalate to a person when needed. Regulatory and ethical considerations started to surface as well, prompting discussions on transparent AI algorithms and data privacy. Nonetheless, the overall impact in 2024 was clearly positive.
Banks that embraced AI saw improved customer engagement, whether through more frequent app usage or deeper emotional connection (feeling that the bank “understands me”). In markets like the US and UK, which we highlighted, AI became a key differentiator among competitors: those who leveraged it wisely reaped reputational gains, while those who lagged faced pressure to catch up.
In conclusion, AI’s adoption in banking during 2024 fundamentally elevated the digital customer experience. By delivering personalization at scale, enabling full-service banking at customers’ fingertips, engaging users in proactive conversations, automating support and broadening accessibility, AI made banking more customer-centric than ever. The past year’s advancements indicate that we are entering a new era of digital banking—one in which AI is embedded in every facet of the customer journey, often invisibly, making interactions smoother and more meaningful.
As we move into 2025 and beyond, banks will likely build on this momentum. We can expect even smarter virtual assistants, more predictive financial wellness tools and further integration of AI into everyday banking operations. The competitive bar for digital CX has been raised: customers will gravitate toward banks that continue to innovate with AI in ways that genuinely improve their financial lives. The “age of AI” in banking has truly begun, and 2024 will be remembered as the year that kick-started a transformation in how we all experience banking in the digital age.
