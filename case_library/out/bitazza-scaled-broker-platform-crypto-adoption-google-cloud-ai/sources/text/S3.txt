Trade at Bitazza: Reasons Why Centralized Crypto Trading Platforms Are Super Secure
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography for security, functioning within decentralized networks built on blockchain technology. By now, you might have some awareness of its presence, especially considering that, according to Statista, the Thai cryptocurrency market revenue is expected to reach US$256.4 million in 2023. In this article, we will delve into centralized crypto trading platforms, exploring what they are and the roles they play in the cryptocurrency landscape.
Centralized vs. Decentralized,
Why Choose One Over The Another
A centralized crypto trading platform is a type of cryptocurrency trading service facilitated by a third-party intermediary, a specialized form of Digital Asset Management (DAM). On this platform, users establish accounts, deposit their funds, and engage in the trading of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. The process involves trading assets listed on the exchange’s order book.
Key Features
- Global Exchange Rates
Centralized crypto trading platforms provide global exchange rates based on current market conditions, making it more comfortable for beginners to enter crypto trading and aiding all traders in tracking rate changes more easily. - Fiat Integration
Many centralized platforms allow users to trade cryptocurrencies against fiat currencies such as THB, USD, EUR, etc., depending on their operational base. This provides a fast lane for users to enter the cryptocurrency market. - Intermediary Control
Centralized platforms are operated and managed by a central authority or a company. This entity serves as an intermediary that facilitates and oversees the trading process. - User Accounts
Users are required to create accounts on the trading platform to trade. These accounts typically involve identity verification processes to comply with regulatory requirements. - Order Book
Centralized platforms maintain an order book that displays buy and sell orders from each user. The order book is managed by the exchange, and users can place market or limit orders. - Liquidity
Centralized platforms often provide higher liquidity compared to decentralized exchanges, as they attract a larger number of traders and facilitate a higher volume of transactions. - Trading Pairs
Users can trade a variety of cryptocurrency pairs on centralized platforms, including major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Tether, and other altcoins. - Security Measures
Centralized platforms implement security measures to protect users’ funds and data. This may include encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA), and other security protocols tailored to each market. - User Experience
