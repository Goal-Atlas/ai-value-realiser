Bitazza Thailand uses Google Cloud and AI to scale its broker platform, gain insights, and innovate, driving crypto adoption.
Bitazza Thailand, as a licensed digital asset broker, is a key driver of crypto adoption in Thailand, a nation consistently ranked among the global top 20 crypto markets.
Functioning as a digital asset brokerage platform, its data team built and scaled its data infrastructure to drive $4.6B in transactions in 2024. The platform integrates multiple source exchanges through secure APIs to provide customers with liquidity and best pricing. Handling this level of volume and complexity, which includes a mix of digital assets, fiat currencies, and third-party feeds, Bitazza Thailand required an innovative and flexible solution.
Bitazza Thailand's data team turned to Google Cloud for its ease of use and scalability, enabling the data team to support an expanding range of use cases.
BigQuery serves as Bitazza Thailand's central data warehouse, consolidating terabytes of data from internal and external sources. The serverless warehouse scales effortlessly to handle volatile markets and serves both business analytics and compliance reporting needs.
Moreover, the robust resource hierarchy of Google Cloud provides a flexible environment where data engineers and analysts can test and explore data products in isolated projects — without compromising the production environment.
For advanced data science and machine learning tasks, the team uses specialized services to innovate with data. Vertex AI Notebooks gives the team on-demand elasticity to handle large datasets. Similarly, BigQuery Notebooks offer a familiar notebook interface, combining the power of BigQuery with the flexibility of Python libraries. This enables the team to rapidly create data models on their BigQuery data, eliminating the need to move data. This seamless workflow accelerates their ability to develop, train, deploy, speeding up the entire machine learning life cycle.
Operating under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO), and the Bank of Thailand (BOT), Bitazza Thailand must process near-real-time and submit accurate daily aggregated millions of transactions. The compliance and risk team uses Google Sheets and BigQuery to generate these trusted, near-real-time reports, to meet compliance and avoid penalties.
In addition, the team uses digital asset reports to proactively detect suspicious trading patterns or fraudulent activities and mitigate risk before it escalates. These capabilities not only help Bitazza Thailand meet strict regulatory requirements, but also protect the company and its customers from financial crime.
Apart from compliance and risks, other business units, such as finance, marketing, and product, use the native integration between Sheets and BigQuery to access and analyze data without interacting with the data warehouse. With this approach, the data team and management can set role and permission schemes, enforcing checks and balances while safeguarding transaction and other sensitive data.
Manual code deployment is tedious and error-prone — especially for fast-moving teams juggling infrastructure, compliance, and product development. Bitazza Thailand recognized early on that automation is key to building reliable, scalable systems without adding unnecessary headcount. To streamline this, the team automated its CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build, which now handles everything from containerization to deployment.
Bitazza Thailand's workflows are fully automated and modular, depending on the nature of the task. For containerized codes, the team uses Cloud Build and deploys to Cloud Run, with a Cloud Scheduler job to trigger it. For smaller, event-driven tasks, they use Cloud Run functions. For more complex data transformations that require specialized software or custom server configurations, they leverage Compute Engine. This serverless approach allows them to manage CI/CD pipelines efficiently without a DevOps specialist.
Building on this solid foundation, Bitazza Thailand plans to continue its innovation with Google Cloud for AI. The team is exploring AI tools that integrate directly with its data warehouse. This initiative aims to streamline critical internal processes, such as the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) operations, which can reduce operating time without compromising security. By leveraging AI, Bitazza Thailand will further strengthen its operational capabilities while minimizing risk to offer all Thai customers the opportunity they deserve.
"We truly appreciate how quickly the Google Cloud team continues to innovate and how much effort goes into their technical documentation. Using both Google Cloud and Google Workspace gives me confidence in the strength and consistency of the Google ecosystem — how seamlessly everything fits together. With Google Cloud, our aim to become a fully data-driven organization is just within reach," says Phongpandecha.
