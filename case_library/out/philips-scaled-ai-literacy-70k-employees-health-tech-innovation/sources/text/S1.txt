Philips Uses AI and ML to Improve Medical Imaging Diagnostics for Philips HealthSuite Built on AWS
Using AWS tools, Philips is tackling artificial intelligence (AI) challenges in the healthcare industry, advancing digital healthcare through medical imaging AI solutions.
Opportunity
Protecting Private Healthcare Data
Privacy and data protection laws, geographical boundaries, and data diversity are some of the many difficult factors that the healthcare industry faces in gathering data and taking full advantage of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a crucial part of analyzing medical imaging data and identifying clinical findings. Health technology company Philips developed a regulatory-compliant, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Its PaaS, Philips HealthSuite, provides tools and cloud capabilities to advance digital healthcare through imaging AI and machine learning (ML) solutions.
Using many of the tools that AWS provides helps us to tackle and solve the AI challenges that exist today to really drive better healthcare outcomes.

Providing Medical Professionals with Access to Philips HealthSuite
As the basis for its infrastructure, Philips uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. To provide medical professionals with access to Philips HealthSuite, the company has adopted AWS IoT Core, which lets the company connect billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and route trillions of messages to AWS without managing infrastructure. By using these and other services, Philips HealthSuite is able to provide its customers with a cost-effective, simple-to-consume set of cloud services so customers can connect any type of IoT device, normalize and store the data on behalf of its customers, and make that data available to authorized solutions.
Moreover, Philips can use AWS to build structured reporting tools for near-real-time feedback and monitoring of AI solutions to combat the challenges of using AI and ML in clinical settings. “We can use capabilities like natural-language processing and language comprehension—when we have authorization from the customer—to take textual reports, structure them, feed them back to the development environment to enhance learning, and then retrain and redeploy models,” says Elad Benjamin, general manager of radiology and artificial intelligence informatics at Philips. As an added benefit, Philips is able to use AWS to deploy solutions in the cloud as well as hybrid models where on-premises capabilities are sometimes needed.
Outcome
Optimizing the Quality of Healthcare
Philips HealthSuite is optimizing the quality of healthcare using AWS. More specifically, by working toward facilitating diagnostic recommendations using AI and ML, medical professionals will have the tools they need to deliver accurate diagnoses and create treatment plans. Using Philips solutions can also help them deliver care quickly and aims to significantly reduce human error. In part by developing solutions on Philips HealthSuite, powered by AWS, Philips aims to improve 2.5 billion lives per year by 2030.
Further, Philips can scale and store data in the cloud. By building Philips HealthSuite on AWS, Philips has the ability to break down data siloes, consolidate medical records, and gain insights from analytics that will streamline workflows and can increase staff productivity. “Using many of the tools that AWS provides helps us to tackle and solve the AI challenges that exist today to really drive better healthcare outcomes,” says Benjamin.
