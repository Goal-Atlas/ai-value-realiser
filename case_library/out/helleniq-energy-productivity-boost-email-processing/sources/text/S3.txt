HELLENiQ ENERGY boosts productivity 70% and scales AI adoption with Microsoft 365 Copilot
HELLENiQ ENERGY operates across the entire energy value chain with a strategy centered on low-carbon solutions. For more than five decades, it has powered progress and innovation in Greece and Southeast Europe, investing in technologies such as photovoltaics, wind parks, CO2 capture, and green hydrogen, while continually embracing new technologies to shape a more sustainable future.

The solution evolved daily with new features, composite scenarios and role-based guidance as the community got more familiar with the tool’s capabilities. “While most digital tools are purpose-built, Microsoft 365 Copilot is a flexible toolbox: it’s up to the user what they do with it,” shares Konstantelos. Yet, that flexibility posed a challenge: scaling everyday AI across the organization.
