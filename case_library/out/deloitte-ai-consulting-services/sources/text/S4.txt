NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 — Deloitte announced the launch of its Human Capital AI solution suite, featuring Workforce Analyzer and Workforce Planner+. These tools are designed to help organizations assess the impact of AI on different workforce segments, streamline and automate processes and workflows, and create and scale business outcomes. Supported by Deloitte’s HR AI maturity model, diagnostic and agentic AI workflow library, the suite also enables the HR function to holistically integrate AI to unlock capacity and build new capabilities to lead the enterprise through AI-driven workforce transformation.
"Deloitte's Human Capital AI solutions are designed to provide organizations with the data and insights they need to effectively navigate the uncertainty and rapidly moving impacts of AI on the workforce and how work gets done," said Greg Vert, human capital AI leader, Deloitte. "We are empowering leaders to harness the full potential of AI to address priority business challenges, create new forms of value, and architect the future human and machine workforce."
Increased investment in Generative and agentic AI has raised expectations while revealing hurdles in scaling, value measurement, governance, and data quality and availability. Organizations have an increased need for on-demand access to labor market insights to focus their AI efforts and make data-driven decisions to redesign work across the enterprise. Traditional labor market insights often involve cumbersome data cleansing and costly storage, making it difficult to synthesize multiple sources without significant manual effort. These challenges underscore the need for solutions to address these complexities head-on.
Key solutions for workforce and workplace efficiency
Workforce Planner+ is an AI-driven solution designed to simplify workforce planning and strategic deployment. Modeling scenarios from numerous projects provides real-time insights that facilitate rapid assessment of role requirements, costs and talent sourcing. With proprietary AI trained on extensive signals, Workforce Planner+ can help ensure accurate labor supply and demand analysis, enabling business leaders to enhance workforce planning and strategic alignment within their organizations.
Workforce Analyzer uses Generative AI to assist in workforce management and operational efficiency. This solution examines the impact of AI on workforce dynamics, helping organizations improve productivity, manage costs and encourage innovation. Workforce Analyzer enables leaders to assess work functions, estimate AI disruption potential in roles, and develop scenarios that enhance efficiency and support growth. It focuses on talent strategies and adoption prioritization, helping organizations navigate AI integration challenges and explore opportunities for improved client relationships and revenue growth.
HR AI Maturity Model, Diagnostic and Agentic AI Workflow Library provides a comprehensive toolkit to help accelerate the AI journey for HR. The research-backed maturity model and diagnostic allow organizations to quickly see how they compare to market-leading practices and create a roadmap across six dimensions: strategy, data, technology, governance, solution delivery, and workforce enablement. The agentic AI workflow library provides 300+ HR workflows reimagined based on the latest reasoning.
"At Deloitte, we believe in harnessing AI not just as a tool for efficiency, but as a catalyst for creating more meaningful and fulfilling work," said Simona Spelman, U.S. human capital leader, Deloitte. "Our new solutions are designed to empower organizations to thoughtfully integrate AI by prioritizing human-centric strategies that help to build resilient, agile teams."
As Deloitte research underscores, the strategic implementation of AI is important for addressing work, workforce and workplace dynamics. AI's ability to automate routine tasks and augment human capabilities presents significant opportunities for enhancing productivity and driving innovation. However, if not integrated thoughtfully, AI can lead to increased workloads, reduced autonomy and feelings of isolation among workers. This underscores the importance of creating a human-AI value proposition that supports human interaction and empowers employees, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.
"Agentic AI is fundamentally reshaping the workforce, and clear, actionable insights are essential for successful implementation,” said Ruth Hickin, VP, Workforce Innovation and Transformation, Salesforce. “Deloitte’s Workforce Analyzer, combined with robust skills data, gives organizations a deep understanding of AI's impact on their talent, helping them make more informed decisions and optimize their workforce during this transformation."
