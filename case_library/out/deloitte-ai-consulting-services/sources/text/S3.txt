Evergreen. It’s what every business strives for—evergreen strategies, models and operations that yield ever-resilient value. But being evergreen takes constant attention and cultivation. It requires turning your data into an investible asset and using it to fuel AI and automation across your enterprise. It means sourcing the skills and technologies you need for the moment, at any moment. Enter AI & Data—the ever ready, ever smart, evergreen way to envision, execute, and operate.
