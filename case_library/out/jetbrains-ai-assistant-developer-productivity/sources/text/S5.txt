JetBrains Recognized in the 2025 Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants
This year, JetBrains’s AI (including both AI Assistant and Junie) was recognized in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants, an industry that we believe is innovating and changing faster than almost any other.
Using AI is now a fundamental part of software development. Developers are increasingly able to automate mundane tasks like generating boilerplate code and writing documentation so they can focus on more strategic and creative work. And the payoff for businesses could come quickly: Gartner predicts that, “Through 2028, a 30% productivity gain in software development will be achieved across enterprises as a result of applying multiple AI-powered tools in the software development life cycle.”
It’s a high-velocity landscape for developers, and JetBrains wants to be sure that our users are empowered with the latest and most valuable technology. It is a constant balancing act between raising productivity without compromising code quality or developer experience.
Here is what our customers had to say:
“Best AI assistant I could ask for, in terms of accuracy and preciseness.” – Read the whole review.
“Both the AI Assistant and Junie generally work well when provided with appropriate instructions. I tend to use it for short tasks that take 3–5 minutes of agent time, which would have taken me 30–40 minutes of work. Great for going through lots of documents (like SQL files) to come up with code that works reasonably well.” – Read the whole review.
“JetBrains AI Assistant has been a valuable addition to our development workflow. Productivity has enhanced with live on the go support available for code suggestions, error tagging, and context awareness.” – Read the whole review.
Our priorities moving forward: embedded security, productivity and transparency
Our focus for the future is on continuing to evolve our AI solutions to empower customers in key areas.
Privacy and security: Unlike other models, Junie is never trained on user data, so customer privacy is never compromised. We also never retain data on our servers or through subcontractors. Privacy and security will continue to be prioritized as the product evolves, and international compliance standards remain at the center of our design and development process.
Productivity and transparency: We’re also focused on balancing code quality with productivity. Both AI Assistant and Junie are designed to take over boilerplate tasks so developers can ship faster, and we will continue to invest in these features. Since Gartner’s research, we’ve increased Junie’s speed by 30% and added MCP support. But we’re also investing in transparency at every level, so that developers always understand what the tools are doing and leaders can understand the ROI of different AI strategies.
Our goal is to bring the same type of seamless experience and powerful features that engineering teams expect from our IDEs into the age of AI, resulting in a better developer experience and higher quality software. We’ve got some exciting developments on the horizon, so stay tuned!
