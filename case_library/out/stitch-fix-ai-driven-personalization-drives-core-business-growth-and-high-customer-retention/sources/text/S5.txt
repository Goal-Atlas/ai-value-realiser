Stitch Fix has introduced a series of AI experiences designed to enhance customization and convenience on the styling platform as the company’s turnaround efforts continue to gain steam.
“When Stitch Fix launched in 2011, we disrupted the retail market,” said Matt Baer, CEO of Stitch Fix in a blog post announcing the updates. “Now, we are rewriting the playbook again, harnessing the power of AI plus human connection to deliver the most personalized retail experience. That is what the future of apparel shopping will look like.”
Leveraging AI along with its 15 years of proprietary data and internal algorithms, new offerings include:
- An AI “Style Assistant” for clients —the company’s new conversational AI Style Assistant engages in dialogue with clients and then uses AI-generated outfit inspiration to help them articulate their individual style preferences. The assistant draws on each client’s StyleFile (style profiles that were introduced last year) as well as previous shopping and purchase behavior, and it gets smarter the more it’s used. The feature is currently in beta and is in the process of rolling out to all clients in the Stitch Fix iOS app.
- A new platform for clients and stylists to connect — Stylist Connect, which also is rolling out to all clients in the iOS app, allows shoppers to communicate with their Stitch Fix Stylists outside of moments when they are creating a “Fix.” Clients can get style advice, ask a question about fit or get tips on trying out the latest trends. “I often think back to the ‘golden age of retail’ when sales associates knew their customers by name, remembered their preferences and could anticipate their needs,” said Baer. “Those personal relationships have all but disappeared from shopping today. At Stitch Fix, they are alive and well — our Stylists serve as trusted partners to our clients — and now, we’re creating opportunities for clients and Stylists to collaborate like never before.”
- Personal styling now available for everyone in the family — clients can now style their partner or anyone else in their household, all from one Family Account.
- Personalized AI Style Visualization — powered by proprietary data, Stylist expertise and the latest advancements in gen AI, Stitch Fix is beginning to offer personalized style visualization that enables clients to see themselves in a variety of outfit recommendations and trends.
- An expanded assortment with AI-driven designs and new brands — Stitch Fix is now integrating gen AI into the design and development of several of its private brands in an effort to spot and respond to trend signals more quickly. The first set of designs using this technology will be available in the coming months. Additionally, the company’s portfolio of third-party brands continues to grow, with new additions including Birkenstock, Varley, Favorite Daughter, Melin Hats and Abercrombie Kids.
These new features join the company’s upgraded online experience, which debuted last year, all part of its ongoing turnaround effort. That effort appears to be beginning to pay off: in its fiscal Q3, which ended May 3, 2025, the company marked a return to revenue growth after several years of declines.
