It’s hard to miss headlines about how much AI will ask of the power grid. But what about the other way around?
John Pressley, managing director of digital transformation at Duke Energy, will discuss how AI is transforming utility operations at DTECH (formerly known as DISTRIBUTECH) convening from March 24-27, 2025 in Dallas, Texas.
Pressley will participate in the session, PG&E, Duke Energy, and PSEG on how AI/ Analytics is reshaping utility work, taking place March 25, from 1:00 PM-1:50 PM.
The panel will discuss how PG&E, Duke Energy, and PSEG are navigating the convergence of AI and generative AI, AR/ VR, analytics, and cloud, and how they have doubled down in their efforts on automation to drive value within their organizations.
Utility experts will share how they have successfully implemented these technologies in their organizations and have achieved tangible business outcomes. They will also provide guidance on how to identify the right target areas, choose the right technology, and get the right sponsorship within the organization to drive value.
Key Takeaways:
- Effective human-machine collaboration can drive productivity, safety, and quality of work effort thus producing better outcomes. Modern technologies can change the existing work methods for the better and offer advantages to both workers and utility.
- Utilities should invest in assessing, piloting, and adopting new technologies that promote human-machine collaboration within the organization to benefit from it and maximize business value.
- New ways of working require transparent communication, reskilling employees, bolstering confidence, and pursuing AI benefits wisely.
