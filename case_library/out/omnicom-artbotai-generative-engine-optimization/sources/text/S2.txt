Dive Insight:
Omnicom is pushing deeper into the generative AI realm with the unveiling of ArtBotAI, its next-generation intelligent content platform that is designed to solve what is billed as a common CMO dilemma around how to efficiently optimize creative content at scale without losing out on quality. ArtBotAI has the power to assemble clients’ digital assets to create personalized experiences and is intended to handle the workload that content studios and one-off tools often struggle with, per release details.
“Elegance at scale—that was the original idea behind ArtBotAI,” said Paolo Yuvienco, chief technology officer at Omnicom, in release details. “There’s never been a core product that could integrate their creative assets, templates, MarTech, AdTech, AI, and first and third-party data. ArtBotAI replaces a messy ecosystem with something simple, beautiful and powerful to serve our client’s content needs.”
ArtBotAI is part of Omnicom’s strategy to implement generative AI into every facet of its business, per release details. The platform’s generative AI functionality stems from LLMs within Omni that are the result of partnerships at the enterprise level with companies including Adobe, Amazon, Getty, Google and Microsoft (OpenAI). Last month, the company consolidated its global production resources under one banner, Omnicom Productions, to better draw upon its internal AI systems, including its ArtBot content automation system (an ArtBotAI predecessor) and its open operating system, Omni.
The latest move from Omnicom follows a strong first quarter, with the company reporting a 5.4% year-over-year revenue boost to $3.63 billion. Organic growth, a key measure of agency health, also grew 4% year-over-year. In May, the company revealed that it would be aligning cultural insights consultancy Sparks & Honey closer to Omnicom Media Group amid a push to bolster its Omni platform. Omnicom will report its second-quarter earnings results on July 16.
