Self-driving cars are slowly becoming less sci-fi and more real-world as companies like Waymo, the autonomous arm of Google's parent, Alphabet, expand into more areas. On Wednesday, Waymo said it's driving in four new cities: Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Philadelphia.
Waymo is starting with manual driving in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis before eventually switching to autonomous operations. In Philadelphia, it's now operating autonomously with a human specialist monitoring behind the wheel. This comes after Waymo said in July that it was bringing a limited fleet of its vehicles to "the most complex parts" of the city, "including downtown and freeways."
Waymo currently offers fully autonomous rides to the general public in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas, through the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace. The vehicles can be summoned either via the Waymo app or Uber, depending on the city. In November, Waymo began driving passengers on freeways in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.
The self-driving company has added several new cities to its roster in recent months. In an Aug. 29 blog post, Waymo noted it's "entering a new chapter and accelerating our commercial expansion." You can find a full list of where Waymo currently operates and plans to expand below.
Waymo's growth extends to its manufacturing facilities. In May, the company said it's opening a new, 239,000-square-foot autonomous vehicle factory in the Phoenix area. The plan is to add 2,000 more fully autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to its existing 1,500-vehicle fleet. Notably, Waymo indicated it received its "final delivery from Jaguar" earlier this year, as it plans for future iterations of its driverless rides. Waymo added that the "facility's flexible design" will allow it to integrate its upcoming sixth-generation self-driving technology into new vehicles, starting with the all-electric Zeekr RT.
Last October, Waymo also announced it's partnering with Hyundai to bring the next generation of its technology into Ioniq 5 SUVs. In the years to come, riders will be able to summon those all-electric, autonomous vehicles using the Waymo app. And in April, Waymo said it reached a preliminary agreement with Toyota to "explore a collaboration" geared toward developing autonomous driving tech, which could someday be factored into personally owned vehicles.
The self-driving company says it's driven over 100 million fully autonomous miles on public roads and has provided more than 10 million paid rides. I've hailed several rides myself in San Francisco, and as off-putting as it can seem at first (especially to see a steering wheel turn by itself), I quickly adjusted, and it soon felt like an ordinary ride.
That's not to say there hasn't been pushback as Waymo rolls out to more cities. The company's vehicles have been involved in a handful of high-profile collisions, including one with a bicyclist in San Francisco and another with a towed pickup truck in Phoenix. (Waymo recalled and updated its software to address the issue.)
Waymo's Safety Impact report notes that over the course of 71 million autonomous miles driven through March 2025, its Waymo Driver technology had 88% fewer crashes leading to serious injuries or worse and 78% fewer injury-causing crashes, compared with "an average human driver over the same distance in our operating cities." It also reported significantly fewer crashes with injuries to pedestrians (93%), cyclists (81%) and motorcyclists (86%).
As Waymo continues to expand and develop its self-driving tech, here's how and where to summon the robotaxi if you happen to be in one of the few cities where the company currently operates its fleet.
Hailing a ride in Phoenix
Phoenix was the first city to open up fully autonomous Waymo rides to the public, in 2020. To hail a ride, download the Waymo app on iOS or Android. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
You can also use the Uber app to summon one of Waymo's vehicles in Phoenix. When you request an UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric ride, you'll have the choice to confirm a Waymo ride, if you're matched.
In addition to hailing a ride, you may also have your Uber Eats meal delivered by an autonomous car. When placing an order in the Phoenix area, you might get a note that "autonomous vehicles may deliver your order." When the Waymo car arrives, take your phone with you to pop open the trunk and grab your delivery. You can opt out of this during checkout if you'd rather have a human deliver your food.
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport became the first major airport to offer fully autonomous Waymo rides to its terminals. Waymo said in September 2025 that it has "served hundreds of thousands of trips to/from Sky Harbor, and it remains the single most popular Waymo destination in Phoenix."
Waymo added freeways access to passengers in Phoenix in November.
Hailing a ride in the San Francisco Bay Area
San Francisco followed suit after Phoenix, rolling out fully autonomous rides in late 2022. It scrapped the waiting list in June 2024, so now anyone can download the Waymo app to ride anytime. The service also operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There's currently no Uber partnership in San Francisco.
In November, Waymo expanded its service area to stretch across more than 260 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area, and added freeway access for passengers. Riders can now hail a driverless ride to San Jose Mineta International Airport, making it the second international airport at which Waymo operates, after Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
Waymo received a pilot permit to operate commercially at San Francisco International Airport in mid-September. The rollout will include three phases, beginning with an onboard safety driver, then moving onto tests without a human driver with Waymo and airport employees, and culminating in commercial operations.
Hailing a ride in Los Angeles County
In November 2024, Waymo scrapped its waitlist for Los Angeles and began welcoming all public riders via the Waymo app. Now any interested passengers can hop in the robotaxis 24/7 and ride across nearly 120 square miles of LA County, including Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, Silver Lake, Playa del Rey, Ladera Heights, Echo Park and Downtown LA, and along all of Sunset Boulevard.
There's currently no Uber partnership in Los Angeles.
In November, Waymo began rolling out freeway access to LA riders.
Hailing a ride in Austin
Riders can hail a Waymo across 90 square miles of Austin, including neighborhoods like Crestview, Windsor Park and Franklin Park and locations like The Domain and McKinney Falls State Park. There are more than 100 Waymo vehicles in the city, with plans for further expansion.
In Austin, the only way to hail a Waymo ride is through Uber -- no Waymo app here. By requesting an UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric, you could be matched with a Waymo vehicle -- and you won't be upcharged. If you'd rather not take a driverless ride, you'll have the option to switch to a standard one. On the other hand, if you want to boost your chances of being matched to a self-driving car, you can go to Account > Settings > Autonomous vehicles, then hit the toggle next to Get more Waymo rides.
Unlock the door, pop open the trunk and start the ride from the Uber app. You'll still be asked to rate your ride at the end, but you won't be asked to tip.
If there are any issues, riders can access human support 24/7 via the Uber app and from inside the Waymo vehicle (there are screens in the front and back that let you quickly summon customer support).
As part of the Uber partnership, Uber will manage tasks like vehicle cleaning and repair, while "Waymo will continue to be responsible for the testing and operation of the Waymo Driver, including roadside assistance and certain rider support functions," the companies said. The collaboration should make autonomous rides accessible to more people, who now won't have to download a separate app to hitch a ride in a robotaxi.
Hailing a ride in Atlanta
Waymo operates across 65 square miles of Atlanta, with plans for future expansions. Like in Austin, you can climb aboard a Waymo robotaxi only via the Uber app. When you book a ride through UberX, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric, you might be paired with a Waymo vehicle at no additional cost. You'll have the option to accept or decline the driverless ride each time.
You can unlock the vehicle, pop the trunk and start the trip all from the Uber app, and you can access human support 24/7 via the Uber app and from touchscreens inside the vehicle.
If you want to boost your chances of being paired with a Waymo vehicle, you can opt in by going to the Uber app, tapping Account > Settings > Autonomous vehicles (under Ride Preferences), and then hitting the toggle next to Get more Waymo rides.
Upcoming expansions
Baltimore
In December, Waymo said it's beginning manual driving in Baltimore. It'll gradually work toward autonomous rides.
St. Louis
Waymo also launched manual driving operations in St. Louis in December, as it builds toward autonomous driving.
New Orleans
In November, Waymo said it'll begin manually driving in New Orleans as it builds toward a robotaxi service there. It's not clear when exactly the public will be able to ride in the city; it could be in 2026, but it's all dependent on the company validating its technology. Waymo is using its fifth-generation driving technology "as we lay the groundwork for our services," the company said, with the option to add future vehicles equipped with its newer sixth-generation tech as it expands.
Minneapolis
Like New Orleans, Waymo in November said it's kicking off manual driving in Minneapolis in November. Once the company has validated its tech there, riders will be able to climb aboard.
Las Vegas
In January, Waymo said it would begin testing with manually driven vehicles in 10 new cities, starting with Las Vegas and San Diego. And in November, it announced its robotaxi service will officially be expanding to those cities in 2026.
As part of the rollout, the company is deploying both its Jaguar I-Pace fleet, which already operates in a handful of other cities, as well as the newer Zeeker RT vehicles that are equipped with Waymo's latest, sixth-generation self-driving technology.
"We've regularly visited Las Vegas over the years and found the Waymo Driver easily adapts to the city," Waymo said in a blog post. "While Las Vegas is unique, its driving dynamics are familiar-similar to cities where we already operate. This familiarity positions us well to help serve Las Vegas's 40-plus million annual visitors."
Waymo said it plans to make its ride-hailing service available in Vegas in the summer of 2026.
San Diego
San Diego is the latest major city Waymo is expanding to in its home state of California.
"As we work to expand our deployment permits, we're partnering with local teams, training first responders, and deepening community relationships so we can best serve the community and its visitors when we open our doors," the company said in a blog post.
It'll deploy both its Jaguar I-Pace fleet and the newer Zeeker RT vehicles equipped with Waymo's latest self-driving technology.
Waymo says it plans to open up its autonomous service in San Diego in 2026.
Detroit
Unlike many of the other cities Waymo is expanding to, Detroit presents the challenge of harsh winter weather. Similar to Las Vegas and San Diego, Waymo will deploy both its current Jaguar I-Pace fleet as well as Zeeker RT vehicles equipped with its latest autonomous technology.
In a blog post, Waymo said it has "regularly tested in Detroit during winter weather to develop our capabilities in snow and ice. We've made great strides in our efforts to operate in heavier snow - including testing in Michigan's Upper Peninsula - and look forward to the 6th-generation Waymo Driver navigating Detroit streets this winter."
London
In mid-October, Waymo said its vehicles are headed to London, making the city its first European location. It'll start driving on the city's roads with humans behind the wheel "while we lay the groundwork for fully autonomous operations," the company said in a statement. "We will scale up based on guidelines established by the UK Department for Transport and Transport for London, and work closely with local and national leaders to secure the necessary permissions to offer fully autonomous rides in 2026."
London is Waymo's second international city, after announcing last year that it's expanding to Tokyo, though passengers can't hail a ride there just yet.
Nashville
In September, Waymo said it's partnering with Lyft to expand to Nashville. Waymo will start driving in the city autonomously in the "coming months," before opening to the public in 2026. Riders will be able to hail vehicles through the Waymo app, and will eventually have the option to be matched with a robotaxi in the Lyft app, too.
As part of the collaboration, Lyft will manage the robotaxi fleet, which includes vehicle maintenance and cleaning, while Waymo will be responsible for the self-driving technology.
Denver
Waymo is set to arrive in Denver this fall "to lay the groundwork for a fully autonomous service in the future," the company said in an early September blog post. It'll deploy a mixed fleet consisting of Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with its fifth-generation Waymo Driver as well as Zeekr RT vehicles with the sixth-gen Waymo Driver. That newer technology "is informed by years of winter weather experience across Michigan, upstate New York, and the Sierra Nevada and engineered to autonomously sustain operations in harsher climates," Waymo said.
Seattle
In early September, Waymo shared that it's heading to the Seattle metropolitan area, noting in a blog post that it "spent years getting to know the area -- from communities around the Lake to its notoriously wet weather." It's not yet clear when exactly that service will launch.
Dallas, Houston and San Antonio
Waymo is currently conducting early testing in Dallas, with plans to launch public rides via the Waymo app next year. The company is teaming up with Avis Budget Group, which will manage the fleet, including vehicle cleaning and maintenance.
"Our partnership with Waymo marks a pivotal milestone in our evolution, from a rental car company to a leading provider of fleet management, infrastructure and operations to the broader mobility ecosystem," Avis Budget Group CEO Brian Choi said in a statement. "Together, we're committed to making scaled autonomous mobility a reality for the people of Dallas, with plans to expand to additional cities in the near future."
Waymo is also planning to launch in Houston and San Antonio next year. In November, Waymo said it would begin rolling out fully autonomous rides in the three Texas cities for employees, before launching for the public in 2026.
New York City
In June, Waymo shared plans to bring its autonomous tech back to New York, after having first manually operated its vehicles there in 2021. It once again began driving manually in the Big Apple in early July, specifically in Manhattan and parts of downtown Brooklyn, as well as in nearby Jersey City and Hoboken. Waymo submitted a permit application with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a human behind the wheel, which was granted in late August.
As part of the New York City permit, Waymo can test up to eight autonomous vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn until September. After that, it can apply for an extension to the pilot testing period.
Existing laws in the state of New York don't permit the same fully autonomous ride-hailing service that companies like Waymo offer in other parts of the country, so Waymo is still unable to charge for rides. In June, Waymo said it was "advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel," adding, "we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future."
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
Waymo said in July that it's bringing a limited fleet of its vehicles to "the most complex parts" of Philadelphia, "including downtown and freeways." And in December, the company said it's now operating autonomously with a trained human specialist behind the wheel.
It's also kicking off manual driving in Pittsburgh before eventually building up to autonomous driving.
Washington, DC
Waymo plans to start offering rides through its Waymo app in Washington, DC, in 2026. The company returned to the nation's capital in January to test its autonomous driving tech. In late March, it said it was bringing more vehicles to the city and working to scale its service throughout the year. In a blog post, Waymo said it'll "continue to work closely with policymakers to formalize the regulations needed to operate without a human behind the wheel in the District."
Miami, Orlando and Tampa
You'll also have to wait until 2026 to ride a Waymo in Miami. The company has been conducting weather testing in the lead-up to that eventual rollout, noting in a blog post, "Our previous road trips to the Sunshine State's challenging rainy conditions have been invaluable in advancing our autonomous driving capabilities."
Waymo will collaborate with Moove, a fintech company that offers vehicle financing, first in Phoenix, where Moove will manage the robotaxi's fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure. In Phoenix and then Miami, "Waymo will continue to offer our service through the Waymo app, and remain responsible for validation and operation of the Waymo Driver," the company said in a blog post.
In November, Waymo began operating fully autonomous rides in Miami with employees, as it prepares for a public launch next year.
It's also rolling out driverless rides in Orlando for employees as it gets ready to launch its service there in 2026.
Waymo is also kicking off manual driving in Tampa, though it's not clear when people will be able to hail a robotaxi ride there. It could be in 2026, if the company has validated its self-driving tech in the city.
Tokyo
In December, Waymo announced it's expanding to Tokyo, making it the company's first international location. Waymo is partnering with Japanese taxi service Nihon Kotsu and taxi app Go. In April, the self-driving company shared that it's finally ready to hit the road abroad.
Waymo says trained Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually drive its vehicles across seven Tokyo wards, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa and Kōtō. This will allow engineers to test and adapt Waymo's autonomous driving tech to local road features and traffic.
"In Tokyo, we are abiding by the same steadfast principles that guide us in the US -- commitment to safety, dedication to earning trust in communities where we operate, and collaboration with local officials and community groups here in Tokyo," Nicole Gavel, Waymo's head of business development and strategic partnerships, said in a statement.
It's not clear when riders will be able to hitch a self-driving ride with Waymo in Tokyo.
The road ahead: Future vehicles
In August 2024, Waymo unveiled the sixth generation of its self-driving technology, which strives to expand the capabilities of its driverless fleet. Smarter sensors are meant to help the cars better navigate in extreme weather, Waymo said. The sixth-gen Driver will come aboard the all-electric Zeekr vehicle, which features a flat floor, more head- and legroom, adjustable seats and a removable steering wheel and pedals. The updated tech is still being tested, but the company says it'll be available to riders soon.
In October, Waymo also announced a partnership with Hyundai to integrate its sixth-generation Driver into the all-electric Ioniq 5 SUV, which, according to a blog post, "will be added to the Waymo One fleet over time." The companies added that they "plan to produce a fleet of Ioniq 5s equipped with Waymo's technology in significant volume over multiple years to support Waymo One's growing scale." Testing with these vehicles will start by late 2025 and become available "in the years to follow."
Currently, everyday riders can't take a Waymo vehicle on highways and freeways, but that may soon change. The company is testing fully autonomous rides on freeways in Phoenix, as seen in an exclusive video shared with CNET in May 2024. It's also now making fully autonomous freeway rides available to Waymo employees in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.
Waymo is working to expand its autonomous driving tech into trucking as well, but it said in 2023 that it's scaling back those efforts for the time being, to focus on ride-hailing with Waymo One. It noted, "Our ongoing investment in advancing Waymo Driver capabilities, especially on freeways, will directly translate to trucking and benefit its development efforts."
