In today’s fast-moving financial world, building smarter models is only part of the journey. Managing them—safely, efficiently, and in alignment with regulatory guidelines can potentially add another layer of complexity. That’s why we are proud to introduce: Experian Assistant for Model Risk Management.
Fully integrated with our industry-leading Ascend Platform™ and powered by ValidMind, this first-of-its-kind solution helps financial institutions streamline the different stages of the model governance lifecycle—from documentation to model validation.
Manual processes, disconnected systems, and slow approval cycles create friction and risk. Our new solution tackles those head-on. Financial institutions can now automate documentation, use and customize pre-built templates, and centralize model governance—all while aligning with regulatory guidelines like SR 11-7 (US) and SS1/23 (UK). And with built-in workflows, teams stay aligned, faster.
It’s all about accelerating innovation without sacrificing oversight. As AI becomes more central to decision-making, strong model governance is no longer optional—it’s essential. Experian Assistant for Model Risk Management gives institutions the tools they need to meet the moment: fast, clear, and transparent.
