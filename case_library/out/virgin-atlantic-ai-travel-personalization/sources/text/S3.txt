Virgin Atlantic has launched its new digital Concierge service, available on both the Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Atlantic Holidays websites, offering travellers an innovative way to plan and book their journeys. This service, powered by OpenAI and developed in collaboration with Tomoro teams, aims to redefine travel planning by providing a personalised, always-on travel companion.
The digital Concierge utilises advanced AI technology to learn traveller preferences and offer tailored recommendations for flights, holidays, and more. It allows guests to interact through tapping, typing, or talking, ensuring a seamless experience. Beyond trip planning, the Concierge also supports Flying Club queries and general customer assistance, creating a uniquely Virgin Atlantic digital experience.
Siobhan Fitzpatrick, Chief Experience Officer at Virgin Atlantic, stated, “Our new Concierge reimagines how we connect with our guests. It listens, understands, and responds, helping to plan holidays and flights with the same intuitive care you’d expect from our teams.”
The launch of the Concierge coincides with the upcoming release of Virgin Atlantic's new mobile app in 2026, which will integrate airline and holiday journeys into a single platform. This initiative marks a significant step in Virgin Atlantic's commitment to blending cutting-edge technology with its renowned customer service.
Nicolai Skabo from OpenAI and Sam Netherwood from Tomoro expressed pride in their collaboration with Virgin Atlantic, highlighting the unique blend of AI technology and personal service that the Concierge offers. This development underscores Virgin Atlantic's mission to deliver exceptional travel experiences across all touchpoints.
