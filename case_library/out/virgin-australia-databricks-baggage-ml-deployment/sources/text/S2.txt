Virgin Australia Airlines' transition from an on-premises data warehouse to the cloud-based Databricks Data Intelligence Platform marked a substantial leap in its data strategy. The goal was to build a trusted, governed central data repository for organizational data and enable improved collaboration, real-time reporting, data-driven decision-making, and self-serve data capability for analysts and operational reporting across the organization. By integrating Databricks' Unity Catalog for seamless data governance, Virgin Australia Airlines optimized its data querying and analytics practices, which streamlined data ingestion, analytics, and data science into one cohesive platform. Virgin Australia Airlines implemented new features, like the near-real-time Baggage Reconciliation System, enhancing operational efficiencies and customer experiences. Databricks adoption facilitated a 75% increase in real-time data availability, a 44% decrease in mishandled baggage, and a 25% revenue boost attributed to insights drawn from analytics. The transformative journey, underscored by a 90% faster deployment of machine learning models and significant improvements in analytical speed-to-insight, has propelled Virgin Australia Airlines forward in the market while pursuing a culture of data-driven operational excellence.

J.P. Morgan Payments processes nearly $10 trillion in payments daily, operating in over 160 countries and over 120 currencies. To support processing, the J.P. Morgan Payments data and analytics team spearheaded a comprehensive project to transition from legacy, on-premises platforms to a public cloud data lakehouse architecture. This architecture transformation involved integrating 50+ systems of bank and financial records — totaling 3PB of data — into a production-ready format, accessible to over 3,000 downstream analysts. These same analysts use various analytical techniques and polyglot languages to extract valuable insights, inform clients of changes, and optimize day-to-day workflows.

Crisis Text Line is a nonprofit organization providing free, 24/7, confidential text-based mental health support in English and Spanish by empowering a community of trained volunteers to meet people in their moments of need. To support over 1.3 million conversations annually and the ever-growing need for mental health support, the organization had a clear opportunity to optimize its service by leveraging Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) workflows to manage global operations more efficiently. Crisis Text Line utilizes a combination of Spark and Delta Lake for data ingestion and transformation. Not only does this help its small engineering team support multiple platform instances globally, but it also allows for tailored data pipeline architecture to address various international regulations for sensitive data treatment. Consolidating key data assets in the data lakehouse enables data scientists to focus on building models at scale rather than managing infrastructure, resulting in improved operational efficiency. From better supporting volunteers in training simulations to more effectively maintaining the clinical quality of our conversations, such technological advancements continue to advance Crisis Text Line's mission of creating technology-enabled human-to-human connections at an unprecedented scale.
Finalists: E.ON Drive Infrastructure GmbH, Flo Health, Sydney Water, and The Ocean Cleanup.

The Auditor-Controller (AC) of Los Angeles County — tasked with managing essential data for the county's finances, personnel, payroll, budgets, and more — faced challenges due to fragmented and outdated data management solutions, hindering the efficiency and accessibility of data across its 41 departments. Recognizing this issue, the Los Angeles AC embarked on a new data and analytics initiative, by implementing Azure Databricks. This strategic choice provided a secure, scalable foundation for data ingestion, curation, and consumption, directly addressing the pain points of limited access, outdated information, and cumbersome manual processes. The integration of Databricks transformed data processes and enhanced the Los Angeles AC's data capabilities with centralized data repositories, robust visualizations for executive decision-making, and streamlined the development of analytics tools. This profound transformation brought operational efficiencies, including real-time annual statistics reporting, vendor payment reporting, as well as comprehensive budget and expense reporting that previously required extensive manual effort and time. These efforts lay the groundwork for future expansions, including more data analysis and machine learning capabilities to benefit county employees and residents.
