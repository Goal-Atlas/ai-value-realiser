Unilever: Transforming Preliminary Hiring Through End-to-End AI-based Digital Process
Abstract Case Intro 1 Case Intro 2 Excerpts
Abstract
This case study explores how Unilever revolutionized its campus hiring process by integrating advanced AI technologies, addressing challenges such as inefficiencies, prolonged timelines, and limited candidate insights. Targeting millennial talent, the company partnered with leading AI vendors like Pymetrics, Amberjack, and HireVue to design a streamlined, digital recruitment strategy. The process was structured into four steps: an application phase, followed by neuroscience-based games to assess cognitive and emotional attributes, AI-driven video interviews for deeper candidate evaluation, and a final assessment at Unilever's Discovery Center. This transformation delivered remarkable results, including a 75% reduction in recruitment time, enhanced diversity in hires, and cost savings exceeding GBP 1 million. The case concludes with Unilever's plans to expand the digital model beyond graduate hiring and refine the system for a more personalized candidate experience.
The case is ideal for faculty teaching management courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels, particularly in disciplines such as Human Resource Management, Organizational Behavior, and Technology in Business. It can also support courses on Leadership and Innovation or Digital Transformation. Topics covered include AI in HR, recruitment process optimization, diversity and inclusion, and change management. Through this case, faculty can encourage students to analyze the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI in business processes, evaluate measurable impacts, and propose strategies for scaling innovations within large organizations
