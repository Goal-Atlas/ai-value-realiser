A new research report by Modality Partnership
The NHS’s largest GP super-partnership, has found that Heidi Health’s ambient AI tool halves the time GPs spend on clinical documentation.
In the 25-day trial, 47 GPs across more than 2,800 patient consultations saw documentation time during appointments reduce by 51%, and after-hours admin drop by 61%. With paperwork drastically reduced, more than three quarters (78%) of GPs said they built better rapport with patients, while 78% reported lower “cognitive load” and improved focus.
Primary care is under extraordinary pressure, with GPs facing rising demand, growing patient complexity, and critical workforce shortages.
The new study found that Heidi’s AI tool not only saved time but also enhanced the quality of clinician–patient interactions by transcribing real-time conversations and automatically generating clinical notes, referral letters, and care plans. This shift contributed to a 58% reduction in documentation-related stress, and nearly one in five clinicians (18%) reported greater enjoyment in their work.
