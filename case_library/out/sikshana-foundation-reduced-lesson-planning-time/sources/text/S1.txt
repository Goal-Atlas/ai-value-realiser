"Sikshana Foundation had the opportunity to be a part of the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2023, on Nov 29, 2023, where we had Mr Prasanna V R, CEO of Sikshana Foundation, eloquently outlining about the Grama Digi Vikasana (GDV) as a model for narrowing the urban-rural technology gap and also emphasise on how it is a model for a comprehensive digital infrastructure platform. Addressing Digital Inclusion, GDV provides shared digital resources through Government Establishments like Gram Panchayat (GP) Libraries. Initially conceived as a pandemic-era solution which enabled learning among students, the Program has evolved into a robust digital infrastructure project. Its users span students, youth, farmers, SHGs, and government officials. Government Panchayats emerge as potential endpoints in the journey towards comprehensive Digital Public Infrastructure."
