# Case File: JP Morgan Chase's AI-Powered Marketing Copy Generation

## Executive Summary

JP Morgan Chase partnered with AI company Persado in a five-year deal to revolutionize their marketing copywriting process. Following a successful three-year pilot that began in 2016, the bank deployed Persado's AI technology to generate marketing copy by analyzing a database of over one million tagged and scored words and phrases. The results demonstrated significant performance improvements over human-written copy.

The AI system achieved remarkable results in controlled testing, with click-through rates increasing by up to 450% compared to human-written copy. In one specific test case, AI-generated headlines nearly doubled weekly applications from 25 to 47. The bank plans to expand this technology across personal banking, home lending, wealth management, and digital advertising to reach millions of customers with more personalized messaging.
