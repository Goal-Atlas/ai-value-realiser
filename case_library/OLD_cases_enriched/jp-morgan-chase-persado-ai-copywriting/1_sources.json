      "content": "JP Morgan Chase has signed a five-year deal with Persado, an AI that writes advertising and communications copy through analyzing a database of tagged and scored words and phrases.\nThe bank inked the deal after a \u201csuccessful\u201d pilot with the New York-based provider. The trial, which began in 2016, saw an uplift in clickthrough rates as high as 450% when text redrafted by the AI was compared to that of a human marketer\u2019s original copy.\nNow, JP Morgan Chase will allow Persado to \u2018write\u2019 more of its marketing creative, aiming to reach \u201cmillions of current and potential customers\u201d with the augmented copy, according to a press release.\nIts chief customer officer, Yuval Efrati, explained the tech would be used as part of its bid to target consumers with more personalized messaging in 2020 and beyond, focusing predominantly on new product and services launches.\nKristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer of JP Morgan Chase, said: \u201cMachine learning is the path to more humanity in marketing. Persado\u2019s technology is incredibly promising. It rewrote copy and headlines that a marketer, using subjective judgment and their experience, likely wouldn\u2019t have. And they worked.\u201d\nShe added the business also hopes to use Persado within its internal communications in the near future \u201cto make things more relevant to employees, as well as in our customer service prompts\u201d.\nPersado\u2019s technology comprises a database of more than 1m tagged and scored words and phrases that an AI sifts through in a search for the perfect copy. The company has previously worked with brands such as Dell, Staples, Expedia and Comcast.\n\u201cWe founded Persado to disrupt choice of words by utilizing AI, machine learning and data,\u201d said Alex Vratskides, co-founder and chief executive of Persado. \u201cOur goal has been to create hundreds of enterprise-wide partnerships with innovative brands like Chase to help them harness the full power of words and drive meaningful communications with prospective and current customers.\"\nChase"

      "content": "America\u2019s largest bank and New York-based Persado said in a statement that they have been working together for the past three years on a pilot to create more resonate copy for Chase\u2019s card and mortgage businesses.\nTests showed that copy generated by Persado\u2019s AI technology lifted click-through rates as much as 450% versus manually written copy, which resulted in a lower uptick of between 50% to 200%.\nPersado\u2019s \u201cMessage Machine\u201d system uses AI, machine learning and computational linguistics to scan a database of more than one million tagged and scored words and phrases to find the ones that connect best with consumers.\n\u201cWe put Persado to the test in various channels, products and services and are highly impressed with the results,\u201d said Abeer Bhatia, head of marketing growth and innovation for Chase Card Services.\n\u201cNot only did they drive better marketing performance, but they created language that resonates more with our customers,\u201d he added.\nIn one test, human copywriters came up with the headline \u201cAccess cash from the equity in your home\u201d coupled with a \u201ctake a look\u201d call for action button. This generated 25 applications a week, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nHowever, a Persado AI version generated 47 applications a week with the headline \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2013 You can unlock cash from the equity in your home\u201d and a suggestion to \u201cclick to apply\u201d.\n\u201cPersado\u2019s technology is incredibly promising. It rewrote copy and headlines that a marketer, using subjective judgement and their experience, likely wouldn\u2019t have. And they worked,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, CMO of JP Morgan Chase.\n\u201cWe think this is just the beginning. We hope to use Persado not just in marketing, but in our internal communications to make things more relevant to employees, as well as in our customer service prompts.\u201d\nWhile the development may sound some alarm bells among creatives, at least one leading industry observer said that machine-driven copy is likely to be assigned only to specific marketing disciplines.\nIn comments reported by the Wall Street Journal, Andrew Van Aken, a senior consultant at Ogilvy Group, said: \u201cFor things like TV ads or a brand campaign or general awareness, that\u2019s an area where people are going to be hesitant because language is so nuanced. You think about Nike and \u2018Just do it\u2019 \u2013 it means so many things to so many people\u201d.\nSourced from JP Morgan Chase, Persado, Wall Street Journal; additional content by WARC staff"

      "content": "How brands like Klarna and Mars are using AI in marketing operations\nLearn how four big brands use generative AI to streamline marketing, from creative ideation and copywriting to data analysis and advertising.\nNow that the novelty of AI has settled and marketing teams are using it across their operations in creative, efficient ways, we\u2019re starting to see some interesting case studies emerge.\nBrands like Mailchimp, Klarna, JPMorgan Chase and Mars are going all-in on AI and integrating it across marketing workflows \u2014 from brainstorming and content creation to analytics and optimization. They\u2019re reaping major benefits like streamlined processes, cost savings and the ability to flex their creativity in fun, unexpected new ways.\nThese brands are miles ahead in figuring out how to make AI work for them, finding unique applications tailored to their marketing needs and goals. The results have been impressive enough for marketers like me to take notes, so I\u2019ve curated all the best findings to share with you.\nMailchimp: Accelerating creativity through AI collaboration\nMailchimp integrates AI right from the brainstorming stage. For its \u201cClustomers\u201d campaign, the marketing team used AI image generation tools (like DALL-E and MidJourney) to quickly create and refine visual concepts. This sped up the creative process by allowing the team to visualize ideas quickly and make real-time adjustments using the AI image tool. The ad from this campaign ranked in the top 5% of Ipsos ads, a success CMO Michelle Taite credited to the team\u2019s openness to experimenting with AI.\n\u201cWe landed on this concept in the first of our meetings,\u201d she explained. \u201cUsually it takes about five meetings to get alignment on a creative concept.\u201d Taite said AI gave them the ability to \u201cshow versus tell\u201d when ideating the concept.\nAI also played a key role in personalizing the \u201cClustomers\u201d messaging across global markets. Generative AI created script variations, while human expertise ensured authentic localization, like a nuanced translation of the clever name into different languages.\nPerhaps most remarkably, Mailchimp advocates for building \u201cAI fluency\u201d amongst employees through continuous experimentation, like using image generators in brainstorms, testing predictive analytics and summarizing drafts with AI. This consistent hands-on approach empowers teams to uncover new use cases and harness AI\u2019s potential as an \u201cequalizer and accelerator.\u201d\nDig deeper: Integrating AI into MOps: Aligning your platforms, data and processes\nKlarna: AI-driven marketing efficiencies and cost-savings\nFor Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later platform, generative AI has been a powerful solution for achieving significant cost efficiencies while amplifying creative output.\nA prime example: Klarna\u2019s use of AI image generation tools like Midjourney and DALL-E to create over 1,000 images for marketing campaigns in Q1 2024 alone. This AI-driven process reduced image production costs by a staggering $6 million annually while accelerating creative timelines from six weeks to just seven days, Klarna\u2019s CMO David Sandstrom told Digiday last month.\nOn the copywriting front, Klarna\u2019s proprietary \u201cCopy Assistant\u201d AI handles around 80% of marketing copy tasks, ensuring consistent brand voice and messaging at a fraction of traditional costs.\nImpressively, Klarna has integrated AI \u201ccopilots\u201d at every stage of its marketing workflow \u2014 from ideation and text generation to image creation and analytics. This systemic infusion of AI catapulted efficiencies, with the company slashing its Q1 2024 sales and marketing expenditure by 11% while increasing campaign frequency.\nThe company said AI integration accounted for roughly 37% of these cost savings, estimated at $10 million annually, highlighting the powerful impact of AI tech when strategically implemented.\nJPMorgan Chase: Integrating AI with every touchpoint\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions, JPMorgan Chase is staking its future in AI \u2014 investing billions into cloud infrastructure, research and enterprise-wide deployment initiatives. Particularly impressive is its innovative use of generative AI for marketing content.\nIn 2019, JPMorgan signed a five-year deal with AI firm Persado to create language models that can write high-performing marketing copy by analyzing massive datasets of tagged words and phrases. In pilot tests, Persado\u2019s AI-generated ad copy delivered click-through rates up to 450% higher than human-written equivalents.\nThe company plans to leverage Persado\u2019s AI for direct marketing in personal banking, home lending, wealth management and digital advertising, reaching millions with personalized messaging.\nKristin Lemkau, the company\u2019s CMO at the time (now CEO of JP Morgan Chase Wealth Management), remarked on the surprising effectiveness of AI in generating creative copy that human marketers might not have imagined. Building on this success, the company plans to expand AI into internal communications, customer service p"
