IHG continues to explore how secured technology innovation can drive increased investment returns for hotel owners, and better experiences for guests.\nGoogle Cloud's approach to cybersecurity, data governance, and privacy also allows IHG to retain control over its data, and enables data and applications to meet compliance and security standards, a key priority for IHG.

For this reason, IHG needed a refreshed mobile experience to compete with the expectations set by today\u2019s tech-first world. Additionally, IHG needed to build this new mobile experience around two priority user groups:\nAs travel started to pick up in 2021, there was an urgency to get to market quickly with both the new loyalty experience and the redesigned app, and it was a massive undertaking. IHG couldn\u2019t just reskin its current app\u2014outdated infrastructure would produce exponential tech debt and complexity down the road. Plus, the new app needed to work with both iOS and Android, be translated into 18 languages and work across IHG\u2019s 17 global brands and 6,000+ hotels.\nIHG tapped long-time partner Accenture to help, and the team worked side-by-side to envision and deliver a new app. With access to Accenture\u2019s insights and intelligence around emerging trends and market demands, IHG was able to dream up new ideas and broaden the horizons of possibility.\nA foundational component of the partnership was the flexible delivery model, or digital \u201cfactory\u201d\u2014a streamlined framework for creating and delivering digital products. The factory makes previously complicated development and delivery processes predictable, repeatable and reliable at scale, across IHG\u2019s global properties. It allows the hotel group to bring new, innovative app features and experiences\u2014like additional payment methods (WeChat Pay in China, for example) or digital check-in\u2014to life faster.\nThe agility of scalable production allows IHG to ramp the factory up or down depending on business cycles or other strategic priorities, to launch multiple upgrades at the same time and to tap key specialized talent when needed. To that end, the model provides IHG with the back-end capabilities and a dedicated delivery team to create state-of-the-art app architecture and analytics. IHG is no longer limited to small groups of highly specialized resources\u2014more people understand how to build and support this important digital asset, reducing risk and maximizing efficiency.\nThe new app was launched with an extensive beta process to ensure there was no impact to booking flow and functionality, and to gather valuable feedback before the full launch. The team released the app to an increasing pool of testers, starting with 12 users close to the program and eventually releasing to thousands of IHG employees and hotel owners, key partners and corporate customers globally. This process improved reliability and allowed the team to quickly address rare error combinations well before the actual launch.\nFinally, the app was launched in phases, which allowed the team to pause and learn from feedback. By late May 2022, IHG fully launched the new IHG One Rewards App at its Americas Owners Conference In Las Vegas.\nThe new app is sleek and seamless, providing an end-to-end personalized experience for booking, check-in, IHG One Rewards Loyalty Program benefit management and communication across all 17 brands. It also supports expanded property attributes and pricing offerings, with increased merchandising opportunities for hotels. Leveraging the digital factory, IHG improved the experience for customers with features like personalized home screens, sticky navigation and \u201cadd to wallet\u201d functionality for reservations.\nThe app is the most efficient place for IHG One Rewards members to manage stays and track progress toward the newly launched Milestone Rewards\u2014a program full of perks based on extensive research into what guests really want. Inside the app, travelers can find an account dashboard to track points and milestones, a chat-based digital concierge and the ability to add the IHG One Rewards card to their Apple or Google wallet, to name a few attributes.\nAlready, the app is seeing exceptional results\u2014a key contributor to IHG\u2019s growth and ongoing success. As of September 2022\u2014compared to pre-pandemic metrics\u2014revenue, usage and downloads are all up more than 20% and growing.\nThe app is also faster and has near-perfect, crash-free performance. And as a testament to usability, it has a 4.9-star rating in the iOS app store, making it a top-rated travel app. Customer reviews describe the app as \u201ceasy to navigate\u201d with a \u201cstunning new design.\u201d One guest even wrote that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t travel without "

      "content": "IHG Hotels & Resorts showcased its interest in innovative guest engagement technologies at SXSW Sydney 2024 with the unveiling of its \u201cMind Lobby.\u201d This experimental activation utilized eye-tracking technology to analyze travelers\u2019 subconscious reactions to various travel destinations, aiming to reveal their true preferences and combat decision fatigue.\nThe Mind Lobby experience involved participants viewing a series of images and videos showcasing different travel destinations while their eye movements and pupil dilation were tracked. This data was then analyzed by an algorithm that identified patterns and correlations, ultimately categorizing the participant\u2019s subconscious preferences into one of five distinct travel typologies: Culinary Indulgence, City Escape, Sundrenched Retreat, Holistic Haven, and Remote Escapism.\nWhile the effectiveness of this technology in accurately determining subconscious desires is still under evaluation, the \u201cMind Lobby\u201d represents a broader trend within the hospitality industry: a growing focus on personalization and leveraging data-driven insights to enhance the guest experience.\nThis initiative comes in response to research conducted by IHG Hotels & Resorts, which revealed that a significant number of Australian travelers feel overwhelmed by the abundance of travel options. The research found that 61% of Aussie travelers feel overwhelmed by important decisions, with 41% citing choosing a holiday destination as one of their top stressors. This decision fatigue can lead to dissatisfaction with travel choices, as travelers may feel pressured to make quick decisions or settle for convenient options rather than what they truly desire.\nIHG\u2019s \u201cMind Lobby\u201d experiment, while still in its early stages, suggests the company is exploring new and innovative ways to address this challenge. By leveraging technology to understand travelers\u2019 subconscious preferences, IHG aims to provide more personalized recommendations and streamline the decision-making process.\nThis focus on personalization and data-driven insights is also evident in IHG\u2019s other recent technology initiatives. The company has invested heavily in its IHG One Rewards mobile app, which has become its fastest-growing booking channel. The app offers a range of features designed to personalize the guest experience and streamline the travel journey, including Travel Wishlists, Wi-Fi Auto Connect, real-time room charges, room details and customization options, a seamless loyalty benefits experience, and an updated Wallet.\nBeyond the mobile app, IHG has invested over $300 million in recent years in its technology platforms, including its guest reservation system, brand websites, and cloud-based data analytics capabilities. The company is also testing attribute-based booking, which allows guests to select rooms based on specific attributes, and is encouraging more guests to use chat-based customer interaction for faster and more efficient support.\nLast year, IHG launched a reimagined digital booking experience that offers greater personalization for guests. This new platform, powered by next-generation cloud solutions, allows guests to select individual room attributes and personalize their stays with in-room welcome amenities, food and beverage credits, pre-paid parking, and the use of their IHG One Rewards elite-qualifying bonus points.\nThese technological advancements are benefiting both guests and hoteliers. Guests enjoy a more personalized and seamless travel experience, while hotels see increased revenue from upselling and enhanced guest satisfaction.\nIHG\u2019s partnership with Apple has led to the introduction of AirPlay in hotel rooms, allowing guests to seamlessly share content from their Apple devices to their guest room TVs. The company also launched IHG Wi-Fi Auto Connect, a feature that automatically connects IHG One Rewards members to hotel Wi-Fi upon arrival, eliminating the need for login credentials.\nIHG plans to continue enhancing its mobile app with new features, such as virtual 360\u00b0 tours of select Hotel Indigo properties and the ability for guests to share Wishlists with friends and family. The company is also investing in rebuilding each hotel\u2019s website and standardizing room type definitions globally, further demonstrating its commitment to providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across its portfolio.\nIHG\u2019s ongoing investment in technology, its strategic partnerships with leading technology providers, and its focus on data-driven insights are positioning the company as a leader in the evolving landscape of hotel technology. By embracing innovation and prioritizing the guest experience, IHG aims to create a more personalized, seamless, and rewarding travel journey for its guests."
