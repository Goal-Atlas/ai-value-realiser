# Case File: Exscientia's AI-Driven Precision Drug Design and Discovery

## Executive Summary

Exscientia has transformed pharmaceutical drug discovery by replacing traditional trial-and-error approaches with AI-driven precision design. The company's integrated platform combines generative AI algorithms, automated robotics, and machine learning to accelerate drug development from 4.5 years to just 12-15 months while reducing costs by 80%. This represents a fundamental shift from human-intensive screening to AI-first molecular design.

The company has successfully validated this transformation with six AI-designed molecules entering clinical trials, including the first-ever AI-designed drug candidate to reach this milestone. Exscientia's approach synthesizes 10 times fewer compounds than industry average while achieving a 75% prediction success rate. The market has recognized this business model innovation through a record-breaking $510 million IPO, the largest for a European biotech company, enabling rapid scaling from 5 to 450 employees across 20+ countries.

Built on AWS infrastructure, Exscientia's automated laboratories operate 24/7 with minimal human supervision, creating a continuous Design-Make-Test-Learn cycle that fundamentally changes how pharmaceutical value is created. This represents "medicines as code" - a new paradigm where drug discovery becomes a systematic, data-driven process rather than an intuitive art.
