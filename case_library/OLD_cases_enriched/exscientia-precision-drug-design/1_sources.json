      "content": "Overview\nExscientia uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout the design-make-test-learn (DMTL) cycle to discover new therapies for patients quickly and relatively inexpensively. Conventional drug discovery methods can take up to 15 years and cost over 2 billion dollars, with an average failure rate of 90\u201396 percent because scientists hunt for specific drug candidates among 1060 bioavailable small molecules.\nBuilt on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Exscientia\u2019s innovative DMTL solution incorporates in silico design\u2014using generative AI algorithms to design compounds in the cloud\u2014and automated robots that make drug candidates in a lab. \u201cWe use generative AI to solve for efficiency and effectiveness,\u201d says David Hallett, Exscientia\u2019s interim CEO and chief scientific officer. \u201cBy predicting the molecular features of a safe and effective drug in silico, we minimize the number of costly experiments. Our platform, built in collaboration with the AWS team, is optimized for speed. We can repeat many DMTL learning loops, improving our drug candidates with every iteration.\u201d\nAbout Exscientia\nExscientia is a technology-driven drug design and development company, committed to creating more effective medicines for patients, faster. Exscientia combines precision design with integrated experimentation, aiming to invent and develop the best possible drugs in the most efficient manner.\nUsing Generative AI for More Efficient Drug Discovery at Reduced Cost\nWorking backward from patient needs, Exscientia defines precise target product profiles (TPPs) that specify the complex combination of properties required by a well-tolerated and effective medicine. AI engineers design algorithms that generate panels of potential drug candidates to meet the TPPs. Active learning algorithms help expert designers to select a short list of drug candidates to synthesize in the lab, because they either move the TPPs forward or refine the models for future DMTL cycles.\nExscientia\u2019s algorithms are trained on publicly available pharmacology data and proprietary in-house data generated from patient tissue samples, genomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and medical literature. By encoding data throughout the process and analyzing experimental results and previous design cycles, Exscientia can optimize upcoming design cycles and promote compound designs that are physically synthesizable.\nUsing this synthesis-aware, iterative approach built on AWS, Exscientia makes 10 times fewer compounds than the industry average. \u201cThe idea is to iron out chemical liabilities to make safer and more effective drug candidates before we ever test them in patients,\u201d says Hallett.\nExscientia has accelerated drug design by up to 70 percent while decreasing capital cost by 80 percent, compared with industry benchmarks. Using generative AI with other tools, Exscientia not only developed better drug candidates faster but also identified the right drug combinations to trial with patients in the clinic.\nCutting Time and Costs Using Automated Robotics to Make Better Medicines\nExscientia has incorporated cutting-edge chemistry synthesis and biology assay lab equipment with automation robots to avoid manual handling of lab equipment. Thus, its lab\u2014orchestrated by AWS microservices\u2014can operate 24/7 with minimal human supervision, \u201cWhen our designs are ready, we can push a button, and within a few days, the robots are making the drug,\u201d says Hallett. Maintaining extremely high levels of security and comprehensive disaster recovery, Exscientia will use this automated robotic capability to reduce the make and test timelines resulting from traditional offshore research contracts used across the industry.\nAs the company closes the loop with its robotic automation lab, it expects further productivity improvements. Data generated in the lab improves algorithmic predictions and speeds up DMTL cycles.\nIntroducing AI-Designed Molecules into Clinical Trials\nSix molecules that Exscientia designed using AI have entered clinical trials. \u201cUsing AWS, we reduce bottlenecks and accelerate the pipeline,\u201d says Hallett. \u201cBy switching on this highly integrated and automated DMTL loop, we can make drug candidates faster and more cost-effective.\u201d\nUsing AWS, we reduce bottlenecks and accelerate the pipeline.\nDavid Hallett\nInterim CEO and Chief Scientific Officer, ExscientiaDid you find what you were looking for today?\nLet us know so we can improve the quality of the content on our pages"

      "content": "This case study has been updated as of 18 March 2024.\nFounded in 2012, Exscientia has quickly established itself as a leader in harnessing AI to identify promising drug molecules and precision-engineered medicine candidates more rapidly and effectively.\nCrucial early funding\nEarly Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) funding proved crucial in demonstrating the potential and practicality of AI-led approaches and underpinned Exscientia\u2019s formation and early development.\nIn October 2021, Exscientia achieved a significant milestone by going public on the Nasdaq stock market, raising $510 million in what became the largest initial public offering for a European biotech company.\nFrom modest beginnings with just five employees, today Exscientia\u2019s 450-strong team operates in more than 20 countries and has six established global offices. Headquartered at the Oxford Science Park in the UK, Exscientia\u2019s operations span across England, Scotland, Austria, and the US.\nBetter drugs faster\nThe Exscientia journey began with a challenge: how do we speed up the process of identifying molecules that could lead to the creation of more effective drugs?\nThe research ambition was clear: find a way to rapidly and effectively analyse large volumes of data that surpasses the capabilities of traditional human and computer-based approaches.\nBBSRC supported this work with a small pathfinder grant, awarded in 2009 for the experimental proof of concept for drug design.\nAs the research gained momentum, a further \u00a3150,000 grant was secured from BBSRC\u2019s follow-on-fund for \u2018commercialising multitarget drug design\u2019, a project that directly supported the formation of Exscientia.\nBBSRC\u2019s investments were key to Exscientia\u2019s evolution, enabling crucial work on the design and testing of novel compounds with machine learning algorithms.\nThe outcome was an automated and adaptive methodology for designing drug ligands to multitarget profiles with a 75% prediction success rate. This groundwork proved vital in laying the foundations for future success as it underpins the AI technology Exscientia uses today for drug discovery.\nInnovative approaches and collaborations\nExscientia\u2019s Centaur AI platform exemplifies the company\u2019s innovative approach to drug discovery. Not only does the platform generate highly optimised molecules that meet the multiple pharmacology criteria required to enter a compound into a clinical trial. It achieves it in revolutionary timescales, cutting the industry average timeline from 4.5 years to just 12 to 15 months.\nExscientia\u2019s success in raising investment and generating revenue highlights the commercial viability of its AI-guided design approach. The company\u2019s rapid growth was well documented in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) impact case study.\nSince then, notable collaborations have underscored Exscientia\u2019s significant role in advancing the drug discovery process. The collaborations were with industry giants such as Sanofi and Bristol Myers Squibb, alongside academic partnerships with institutions like the University of Oxford and MD Anderson Cancer Center.\nThese partnerships have further informed Exscientia\u2019s understanding of patient needs, ensuring future solutions meet real-world medical requirements and expectations.\nClinical development\nExscientia\u2019s first AI-designed molecule was created for Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Pharma) to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. It took just 12 months to discover and represents the first ever AI-designed drug candidate to enter clinical trials.\nSumitomo Pharma later announced that it was not continuing with this molecule. However, two additional compounds also designed for Sumitomo are ongoing in clinical trials.\nThe company was able to bolster its emerging pipeline with further wholly and partially owned novel drug candidates. In March 2023, it announced a series of programmes across oncology and immunology and inflammation that were either in clinical stage or investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies.\nThe latter involves a series of tests that measure the safety of new drug candidates before clinical trials commence, a requirement for US Food and Drug Administration approval.\nGTAEXS617\nA cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor, GTAEXS617, developed in partnership with GT Apeiron, was also on track to enrol the first patient in a phase 1/2 study.\nThis programme showcases what makes an Exscientia drug unique: precision design aiming to transform patient benefit and patient selection strategies.\nIn October 2022 at the ENA congress, the company highlighted patient selection data. For the first time, Exscientia showed how it integrates machine learning, data from primary human tumour samples and multi-omics sequencing capabilities to predict the tumour efficacy of a drug candidate.\nCDK7 is a specialised protein involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and regulating transcription (turning DNA into proteins). It is also an importan"

      "content": "OXFORD, England--July 10, 2024-- Exscientia plc (Nasdaq: EXAI) today announced it will be expanding its work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use the cloud provider\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to power its platform for end-to-end drug discovery and automation.\nExscientia\u2019s platform uses generative AI models and the scalability and flexibility of AWS to securely, quickly and efficiently design drug candidates that aim to better target specific diseases and patients, with the goal of accelerating early drug development at a lower cost. The industry-standard pace of drug discovery is hampered by conventional high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches, which involves outsourcing large-scale chemical synthesis and biological testing to contract research organisations. Exscientia deploys generative AI in its DesignStudio to \u2018learn\u2019 rather than to \u2018screen\u2019 for discoveries in vast chemical space. The company\u2019s UK based AutomationStudio then synthesises and tests drug candidates that were identified by its DesignStudio as having high potential, making extensive use of state-of-the-art robotics to drive efficiency in the molecular synthesis process. Data from the testing completed at the AutomationStudio is then fed back to its DesignStudio to further improve its generative AI algorithms. By impacting both the screening stage and the synthesis and testing stage of drug discovery, Exscientia aims to accelerate the pace of drug development, closing the loop between in silico design and wet-lab synthesis.\nExscientia\u2019s platform, which is built using AWS technologies, supports its Design-Make-Test-Learn (DMTL) loops and spans generative AI, active learning, ML, physics-based systems and many other predictive methods. It also draws on large language models via Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes high-performing foundation models from leading AI startups and Amazon, available through a unified application programming interface (API). Exscientia expects that \u2018closing the loop\u2019 of virtual design and physical experimentation on AWS will benefit its internal discovery projects as well as its collaborative programmes, such as with Sanofi, and potential future partnerships.\n\u201cExtending our collaboration with AWS beyond our DesignStudio to include the robotic automation of synthesis and testing of our molecular designs was the logical next step for Exscientia,\u201d said John Overington, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer of Exscientia. \u201cWe were seeking a solution that had flexibility and scalability, combined with high performance and generative AI capabilities. We also wanted a collaborator that is creative and passionate about life sciences. AWS ticks all of these boxes.\u201d\n\u201cOur mission is to transform the way the biopharma industry invents impactful medicines, by pairing the best available human science, ingenuity and AI/ML tech expertise with innovative experimental automation technologies to increase the quality and capacity of drug design, discovery and development,\u201d said David Hallett, Ph.D., interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of Exscientia. \u201cBy encoding, automating and integrating the loop of design, synthesis and testing with our generative design workflows in our new AutomationStudio, we have taken the next step to increase the speed of learning, and to reduce the time and cost of exploring new therapeutic alternatives. We believe that working with AWS will accelerate the achievement of our goal to deliver higher-quality, precision designed future therapies to patients in need, faster.\u201d\n\u201cThe cloud is transforming the life sciences industry and helping to accelerate the pace of innovation. We\u2019re excited that Exscientia is expanding its use of AWS\u2019 generative AI and ML solutions to further speed up the discovery of new treatments for patients,\u201d said Patrick Lampl\u00e9, Principal Healthcare & Life Sciences Tech Strategist \u2013 Worldwide, at Amazon Web Services. \u201cThe use of AI is also enabling Exscientia to automate their labs and processes, which will help to lower the costs associated with drug development.\u201d\nAbout Exscientia\nExscientia is a technology-driven drug design and development company, committed to creating more effective medicines for patients, faster. Exscientia combines precision design with integrated experimentation, aiming to invent and develop the best possible drugs in the most efficient manner. Operating at the interfaces of human ingenuity, artificial intelligence (AI), automation and physical engineering, we pioneered the use of AI in drug discovery as the first company to progress AI-designed small molecules into a clinical setting.
