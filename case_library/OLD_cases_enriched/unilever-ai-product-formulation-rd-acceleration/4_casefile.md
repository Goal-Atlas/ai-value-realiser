- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: AI reduced experimental requirements from 1,000 experiments to a fraction of the time
- **Evidence**: "In the past we might have had to carry out 1,000 experiments to get the data we needed for a new ingredient, she said. Now, the firm can do it in a fraction of the time."

- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Unilever boasts one of the highest concentrations of robots doing material chemistry in the world
