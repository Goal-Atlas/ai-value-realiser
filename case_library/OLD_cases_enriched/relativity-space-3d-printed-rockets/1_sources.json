Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nStartup Relativity Space sent what it\u2019s calling the \u201cworld\u2019s first 3D-printed rocket\u201d toward space on Wednesday, vaulting it into the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Though, it suffered an engine issue after launch and failed to reach orbit.\nTerran 1, a 110-foot-tall (33.5-meter) vehicle designed to haul lightweight satellites into orbital space, lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Florida\u2019s eastern coast at just before 11:30 pm ET. The rocket, powered by super-chilled methane and oxygen, burned a bright blue-green against the night sky.\nAfter the first stage of the rocket \u2014 the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial thrust at liftoff \u2014 expended its fuel, it detached from the rocket\u2019s upper stage. But the engine meant to propel that portion appeared to ignite only briefly, leaving the rocket without enough power to reach orbit.\nThe mission, nicknamed \u201cGood Luck, Have Fun,\u201d lofted what the company described as a prototype vehicle, along with a hunk of metal \u2014 the first object printed by Relativity\u2019s massive 3D printer \u2014 as a commemorative token. It was not carrying a client satellite, as will be the case with the company\u2019s future rocket launches.\nRelativity had been aiming to get its rocket off the ground earlier in March, but two prior launch attempts were quashed by issues that included getting the propellant to sufficiently cold temperatures, bad weather, and unsatisfactory fuel pressure.\nSeveral hiccups the company faced during its March 11 attempt -\u2014 including a boat entering a restricted area within the rocket\u2019s path at sea \u2014 came late in the countdown. Another dramatic moment during that attempt ended with ignition of all nine of the rocket\u2019s engines \u2014 but they shut off just moments later, leaving Terran 1 on the pad. The company said computers automatically aborted the launch attempt because of a detected software issue.\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s event, Relativity cofounder and CEO Tim Ellis had noted in a March 7 Twitter post that he hoped to see the company\u2019s Terran 1 rocket notch a success on its first launch attempt.\n\u201cOf course, the rocket-loving engineer in me wants to see us be the first privately-funded AND first liquid-propellant rocket to ever reach orbit on the first try. That would be truly unprecedented,\u201d he tweeted.\nBut Ellis acknowledged that even watching the rocket clear the launchpad would be a cause for celebration, and that getting the rocket through Max Q \u2014 the moment it endures the maximum amount of pressure during flight, about 80 seconds after liftoff \u2014 would be a \u201ckey inflection\u201d point.\nThe rocket did successfully achieve that milestone on Wednesday.\nSince 2015, Relativity has worked toward developing its first launch vehicle to gauge the success of its founding thesis \u2014 that rockets can be quickly, cheaply and efficiently built using additive manufacturing, otherwise known as 3D printing.\nMost rockets today rely on some 3D-printed parts, but 85% of Relativity\u2019s Terran 1 rocket is fabricated with this process.\n\u201cI started my career as a propulsion engineer working for Jeff Bezos\u2019 company Blue Origin, where I designed and developed rocket engines starting from a blank sheet of paper,\u201d Ellis told CNN\u2019s Kristin Fisher in an interview earlier this month. \u201cI actually ended up doing the first metal 3D printing at Blue Origin. \u2026 I realized that instead of printing just bits and parts of a rocket, that 3D printing was really a completely new approach to manufacture.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s factory in Long Beach, California, is unlike its competitors. Massive 3D-printing machines tucked behind large hangar doors slowly pour metal to form the hulking fuselages that make up a rocket\u2019s main body.\nThere are dozens of rocket startups, but Relativity has been a standout for its ability to raise capital and attract high-profile contracts before making its first launch attempt. Still, the Terran 1 rocket that failed its first launch attempt on Wednesday may not end up being the company\u2019s showcase product.\nAbout $1.65 billion in launch contracts are already on the startup\u2019s books. But those deals are \u201coverwhelmingly for our larger reusable rocket Terran R,\u201d Ellis noted. Terran R is still in the early stages of development.\nThe company envisions using the more compact Terran 1 rocket primarily for deploying small satellites that are part of larger constellations, which can require maintenance for technology upgrades or replacement of malfunctioning satellites.\nThe larger Terran R rocket is expected to have the capacity to launch about 44,000 pounds (20,000 kilograms) \u2014 or 16 times more mass than what Terran 1 can manage \u2014 to low-Earth orbit. That puts Terran R in the \u201cmedium-heavy lift\u201d class, which is the same category as the Falcon 9 rockets launched by SpaceX, the most prolific private launch company.\n\u201cMedium-heavy lift is clearly "

(AP) \u2014 A rocket made almost entirely of 3D-printed parts made its launch debut Wednesday night, lifting off amid fanfare but failing three minutes into flight \u2014 far short of orbit.\nREAD MORE: Four astronauts fly SpaceX crew ship home, ending 5-month ISS mission\nThere was nothing aboard Relativity Space's test flight except for the company's first metal 3D print made six years ago.\nThe startup wanted to put the souvenir into a 125-mile-high (200-kilometer-high) orbit for several days before having it plunge through the atmosphere and burn up along with the upper stage of the rocket.\nAs it turned out, the first stage did its job following liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and separated as planned. But the upper stage appeared to ignite and then shut down, sending it crashing into the Atlantic.\nIt was the third launch attempt from what once was a missile site. Relativity Space came within a half-second of blasting off earlier this month, with the rocket's engines igniting before abruptly shutting down.\nAlthough the upper stage malfunctioned and the mission did not reach orbit, \"maiden launches are always exciting and today's flight was no exception,\" Relativity Space launch commentator Arwa Tizani Kelly said after Wednesday's launch.\nMost of the 110-foot (33-meter) rocket, including its engines, came out of the company's huge 3D printers in Long Beach, California.\nRelativity Space said 3D-printed metal parts made up 85 percent of the rocket, named Terran. Larger versions of the rocket will have even more and also be reusable for multiple flights.\nOther space companies also also rely on 3D-printing, but the pieces make up only a small part of their rockets.\nFounded in 2015 by a pair of young aerospace engineers, Relativity Space has attracted the attention of investors and venture capitalists.\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Think college students seeking an opportunity to send their own experiments into space.\nLots of people are making lots of things with 3D-printed parts but no one has ever made anything as large as an orbital rocket and tried to send it into space.\nFour years ago, News 6 and Erik von Ancken took a trip to the main Relativity Space factory in Los Angeles to see how they do it and why they do it.\n[TRENDING: Become a News 6 Insider]\nJordan Noone, chief technology officer and co-founder of Relativity Space, showed News 6 the world\u2019s largest 3D metal printer that prints the entire rocket sections at a time.\nToday\u2019s launch attempt for #GLHF Terran 1 was scrubbed due to exceeding launch commit criteria limits for propellant thermal conditions on stage 2.

Their goal is to build a rocket from scratch to space in 60 days.\nThe first one, launching from the Kennedy Space Center, is called the Terran One \u2014 meaning \u201cof the Earth\u201d because it is printed with materials of the Earth, namely aluminum.\nRelativity said its ultimate goal is to put a printer on the Moon and then Mars to print parts for missions without having to wait for them from Earth.\nFor now, Wednesday afternoon\u2019s goal is just to put the Terran One into orbit with no payload. It\u2019s a test flight called \u201cGood luck, have fun.\u201d\nThe launch will be from a recycled launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Pad 16.\nRelatively took the time not just to rebuild the pad but also to clear it. Crews had to bulldoze the brush because it hadn\u2019t been used in so long.\nRelativity Space Cofounder and CEO said, \u201cWe will work toward our next launch window in the coming days. Due to methane/Liquid Natural Gas propellant conditioning, it will take a few days until our next attempt.\u201d\nAt Jetty Park on Wednesday, crowds gathered to try to witness history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s history in the making. This is exciting and opens up a lot of other things to happen,\u201d said Jean Cronin, visiting from Pennsylvania.\nLarry Pizzolato from Chicago added, \u201cIt\u2019s got to save money in the long run and the more money you save the more launches you get to do, the more technology you\u2019re going to develop and it\u2019s better for everybody.\u201d\nGet today\u2019s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:"

Although the mission failed to reach orbit due to a second-stage engine issue, Relativity Space deemed the flight a success, demonstrating that the rocket\u2019s 3D-printed materials could withstand the intense atmospheric pressures during launch.\nOne month after the Terran 1 launch, Relativity Space announced a change in direction, focusing on the design, development, and production of the new Terran R launch vehicle.\nThe company aimed to apply lessons learned from the Terran 1 test flight to meet customer demand for disruptive, diversified launch capabilities in an underserved and rapidly growing payload market.\nThe Terran R stands 284 feet (86.6 meters) tall with a 17.7-foot (5.4-meter) diameter payload fairing. Its design serves both commercial and government customers by delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit (LEO), medium-Earth orbit (MEO), and geostationary orbit (GEO). The rocket\u2019s first stage will be fully reusable, with planned landings on a drone ship positioned downrange from the launch site.\nConstruction is underway at Launch Complex 16 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base, which includes laying new foundations, installing piles, and pouring concrete for the Terran R launch pad and supporting facilities. The rocket will make its inaugural flight in 2026."
