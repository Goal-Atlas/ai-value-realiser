# Case File: Relativity Space's 3D-Printed Rocket Manufacturing

## Executive Summary

Relativity Space has pioneered a transformational approach to rocket manufacturing through additive manufacturing (3D printing), fundamentally reimagining how rockets are designed, built, and deployed. The company's Terran 1 rocket is 85% 3D-printed, representing the world's first orbital-class rocket built almost entirely through additive manufacturing. This approach reduces part count from thousands to under 1,000 components, with some engines containing just 3 parts compared to traditional engines with 3,000 parts.

The transformation has generated significant commercial validation, with $1.65 billion in launch contracts secured before the company's first launch attempt. Relativity's manufacturing approach enables rockets to be built from scratch to space in 60 days, dramatically compressing traditional multi-year development cycles. The March 2023 Terran 1 test flight successfully demonstrated that 3D-printed materials could withstand the intense atmospheric pressures during launch, validating the technical feasibility of this manufacturing transformation.

Beyond cost and speed advantages, this approach democratizes space access by significantly decreasing costs and enabling new customer segments like college students to send experiments to space. The company's ultimate vision extends to printing rocket components on the Moon and Mars, eliminating the need to transport parts from Earth for future missions.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Market Validation (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Relativity has demonstrated strong ability to raise capital and attract high-profile contracts before making its first launch attempt
- **Evidence**: "There are dozens of rocket startups, but Relativity has been a standout for its ability to raise capital and attract high-profile contracts before making its first launch attempt."
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Vague claim about 'standout' status without specific metrics or attribution
- **Recommendation**: Find specific funding amounts or investor names to strengthen the claim

**C2 - Contract Value (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: The company has secured $1.65 billion in launch contracts
- **Evidence**: "About $1.65 billion in launch contracts are already on the startup's books."
- **Source**: S1

**C3 - Manufacturing Thesis (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: 3D printing enables rockets to be built quickly, cheaply and efficiently
- **Evidence**: "Since 2015, Relativity has worked toward developing its first launch vehicle to gauge the success of its founding thesis — that rockets can be quickly, cheaply and efficiently built using additive manufacturing, otherwise known as 3D printing."
- **Source**: S1

**C4 - Manufacturing Transformation (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: 3D printing represents a completely new approach to manufacturing rockets
- **Evidence**: "I realized that instead of printing just bits and parts of a rocket, that 3D printing was really a completely new approach to manufacture."
- **Source**: S1

**C5 - Market Access (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: 3D printing significantly decreases cost and increases access to spaceflight
- **Evidence**: "The idea is to significantly decrease cost and increase access to spaceflight. Think college students seeking an opportunity to send their own experiments into space."
- **Source**: S4

**C6 - Parts Reduction (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: 3D printing reduces parts count from thousands to under 1,000, leading to cost and lead time reduction
- **Evidence**: "We target under 1,000 parts for our rockets. For example, the engine you saw has just three parts on it where traditionally that can have 3,000 parts, and all of that is due to the printing, and that all leads into that cost and lead time reduction."

**C7 - Production Speed (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: The company's goal is to build a rocket from scratch to space in 60 days
- **Evidence**: "Their goal is to build a rocket from scratch to space in 60 days."
- **Source**: S4

**C8 - Component Reliability (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: 3D printing makes rocket components more reliable by printing as single pieces
- **Evidence**: "The rocket engine nozzle is printed as one piece and that makes it more reliable."
- **Source**: S4

**C9 - Investor Interest (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Relativity Space has attracted significant investor attention and venture capital funding
- **Evidence**: "Founded in 2015 by a pair of young aerospace engineers, Relativity Space has attracted the attention of investors and venture capitalists."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Vague claim without specific funding amounts or investor names
- **Recommendation**: Find specific funding rounds or investor details to strengthen the claim

**C10 - Technical Validation (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: The Terran 1 test flight successfully demonstrated that 3D-printed materials could withstand intense atmospheric pressures during launch
- **Evidence**: "Although the mission failed to reach orbit due to a second-stage engine issue, Relativity Space deemed the flight a success, demonstrating that the rocket's 3D-printed materials could withstand the intense atmospheric pressures during launch."
