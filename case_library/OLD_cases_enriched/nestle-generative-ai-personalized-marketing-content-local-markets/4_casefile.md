# Nestlé: Generative AI for Personalized Marketing Content in Local Markets

## Executive Summary

Nestlé has implemented a comprehensive AI-driven marketing transformation focused on creating personalized content at scale through digital twin technology and AI-powered creative optimization. The company has developed an in-house content service using 3D virtual replicas of products, enabling rapid adaptation of marketing materials for different markets, seasons, and digital channels without requiring physical reshoots.

Key achievements include establishing 4,000 digital product twins with plans to expand to 10,000, shifting 72% of media investment to digital platforms, and implementing AI-driven creative quality scoring that has demonstrated measurable ROI improvements.
