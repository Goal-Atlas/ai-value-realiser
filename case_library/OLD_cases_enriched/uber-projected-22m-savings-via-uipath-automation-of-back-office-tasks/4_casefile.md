# Case File: Uber's RPA Automation of Back-Office Tasks

## Executive Summary

Uber has implemented a comprehensive RPA automation program using UiPath to optimize back-office operations across multiple business units. After three years of deployment, the company has deployed over 100 automations in production, generating an estimated $10 million in annual savings. The initiative has particularly transformed Uber Freight's invoicing operations, expanding from handling one customer and shipper to nearly 100 customers and shippers across seven main portals.

The automation program demonstrates significant operational improvements, including increased invoice processing coverage from less than 20% to handling nearly 100 customers, enhanced customer satisfaction, and reduced processing errors. Additionally, Uber's broader digital transformation efforts have yielded substantial process improvements, including a 70% increase in ad sales process speed and 50% faster advertising demand intake, supported by over 100 modernized cloud processes and 75+ custom operational dashboards.
