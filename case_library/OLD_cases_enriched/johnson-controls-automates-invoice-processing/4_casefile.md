# Johnson Controls: Invoice Processing Automation Case Study

## Executive Summary

Johnson Controls, a Fortune 500 building technology leader with over $25B in annual revenue, has successfully implemented intelligent document processing (IDP) to automate invoice processing at massive scale. The company processes hundreds of thousands of invoices daily across its global operations in 150+ countries. By deploying Indico Data's Unstructured Data Platform alongside RPA technology, Johnson Controls created a touchless accounts payable system that aims to achieve 90% hands-free processing by year-end.

The automation initiative addressed the challenge of handling invoices from tens of thousands of vendors without maintaining separate templates for each. The pilot successfully demonstrated the technology's ability to extract relevant fields from invoices, match them with purchase orders and goods-received notices, and integrate with the company's ERP system. Additionally, Johnson Controls implemented Debt Register for collections, improving their collection rate from 20% to 27%, saving $1.8M annually, with combined efforts achieving a 36% collection rate and $17M in increased collections.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Invoice Processing Volume ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Johnson Controls processes hundreds of thousands of invoices per day across the organization worldwide

**Evidence**: Chris Engel, Senior Manager of RPA and AI at Johnson Controls, directly stated that the company "deals with 'hundreds of thousands' of invoices per day across the organization, worldwide." This represents massive scale operations requiring sophisticated automation solutions.

**Assessment**: Specific, quantifiable claim with direct supporting quote from company representative.

### C2: Automation Goals ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Johnson Controls aims to achieve 90% hands-free invoice processing by end of year

**Evidence**: Engel clearly articulated the company's target: "Our goal from an IT standpoint is to get up in the 90s in terms of a percentage being handled hands-free. I'm confident we'll make it to 90%, probably by the end of the year."

**Assessment**: Clear, measurable goal with timeline, directly quoted from company IT representative.

### C3: Technology Validation ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: The pilot proved the technology works for creating a touchless AP system

**Evidence**: According to Engel, "If they all match up, you wind up having a touchless AP system. In practice, exceptions in the business process and other 'internal workings' sometimes thwart the automation routines. But the pilot proved the technology works."

**Assessment**: Specific claim about pilot results with relevant supporting quote explaining the technology validation.

### C4: Company Profile ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Johnson Controls is a Fortune 500 leader with more than $25B in annual revenue

**Evidence**: The case study states: "Johnson Controls is a Fortune 500 leader in building technology with more than $25B in annual revenue."

**Assessment**: Verifiable company facts (Fortune 500 status and revenue) with direct supporting quote.

### C5: Monthly Invoice Volume ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim**: Johnson Controls processes approximately 100,000 invoices each month

**Evidence**: Source states: "With operations in 150+ countries and approximately 100,000 invoices processed each month, Johnson Controls runs AR at massive scale."

**Assessment**: **INCONSISTENCY DETECTED** - This claim conflicts with C1 which states "hundreds of thousands per day." 100,000 per month would be roughly 3,300 per day, which is significantly less than "hundreds of thousands per day." These figures require reconciliation.

### C6: Collections Improvement ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Collection rate increased from 20% to 27% with Debt Register, saving $1.8M annually

**Evidence**: Clear metrics provided: "Before Debt Register: 20% collection rate, costing $3.6M annually - With Debt Register: collection rate increased to 27%, saving $1.8M annually"

**Assessment**: Specific, quantifiable metrics with clear before/after comparison and financial impact.

### C7: Combined Collections Results ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Combined collection rate rose to 36%, increasing overall collections by $17M

**Evidence**: "Combined (Debt Register + DCAs): total collection rate rose to 36%, increasing overall collections by $17M"

**Assessment**: Concrete performance metrics with specific financial impact figure.

### C8: Tool Effectiveness ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Debt Register allows more effective cash collection while saving time and reducing frustrations

**Evidence**: Angelica Bontea, Senior Finance Manager, testified: "Debt Register is an incredibly flexible and fast tool that delivers results. It allows us to collect cash more effectively, saving time and reducing frustrations. The team appreciates its ease of use and the immediate impact it has on our collections process."

**Assessment**: Qualitative assessment with direct testimonial quote supporting the claim about tool effectiveness.
