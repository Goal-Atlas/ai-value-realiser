      "content": "John Deere put its expanding digital ecosystem at the center of its long-term growth strategy during its investor day.\nIt outlined how connected equipment, software and online services will drive recurring revenue for John Deere even as market pressures weigh on near-term performance. Executives said Deere now has more than 1 million connected machines in operation and that its Operations Center platform covers about 500 million engaged acres globally. The company aims to increase that to 600 million engaged acres by 2030. Deere said that target reflects stronger digital adoption across crops, construction and turf segments.\nDeere\u2019s digital push extends beyond the Operations Center itself. Chief technology officer Jahmy Hindman told investors the company is tracking a broader universe of digital touchpoints as more customers use Deere apps, financial tools and online storefronts.\n\u201cFor the average monthly digital users \u2014 unique users, unique an important word there \u2014 they can walk through the digital door for us in a multitude of ways,\u201d Hindman said. \u201cOperations Center is one, MyFinancials is another, Equipment Mobile is another, Shop.Deere.com, and so on. There\u2019s a multitude of ways they can connect with us digitally. We want to measure the unique number of customers that come in that way.\u201d\nHindman said Deere sees expansion opportunities across all production systems but highlighted one segment where digital adoption and connected-unit potential remain especially strong.\n\u201cI\u2019d call out a couple that are significant in terms of the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe turf opportunity is significant in terms of the number of units we can connect to and the number of customers we can touch.\u201d\nHow John Deer is scaling its digital business\nDeere did not introduce new consumer-facing ecommerce initiatives at the event, but the company is increasingly weaving digital transactions into its service model.\nCustomers can order parts, upgrade features, activate subscriptions and connect with dealers through the same digital platforms they use to monitor equipment performance. That effectively turns Deere\u2019s digital footprint into a commerce channel.\nAnalysts say this shift mirrors the broader industrial trend toward monetizing software, data and aftermarket services to counterbalance cyclical equipment sales.\nThe company also highlighted advances in automation and machine intelligence. It noted that improvements in sensing, guidance and autonomous features depend on the same connected-machine infrastructure Deere has built over the past decade. Executives framed automation not as a standalone product line but as a capability that emerges from the integration of hardware, software and data.\nDespite Deere\u2019s long-term vision, the market response was subdued. Shares fell after the event as investors weighed the company\u2019s targets against continued pressure on farm incomes, high financing costs, and global demand uncertainty. The targets included 10% annual equipment sales growth through 2030 and plans to lift operating margins to around 20% later in the decade.\nThe presentations made clear that Deere\u2019s strategy hinges on expanding its base of connected customers and digital users \u2014 the gateway to automation, services and ecommerce-linked revenue. Deere\u2019s challenge will be translating that engagement into financial results during a period of ongoing volatility in the agriculture sector.\nSign up\nSign up for a complimentary subscription to Digital Commerce 360 B2B News.

      "doc_type": "Case Study",
      "content": "This post was originally published on the Digital Initiative\u2019s classroom blogging platform.\nSee how a 179-year-old company has created the go-to platform for the agricultural industry, allowing John Deere to compete against both other farm equipment manufacturers as well as new Ag Tech entrants.\nJohn Deere is the number one farm equipment manufacturer in the world with 2016 worldwide revenues of $26.6B.[1] In 2012 John Deere created the open platform, MyJohnDeere, an information system to help agricultural producers optimize the management of production data, equipment information and farm operations. The company provides an interesting case study to see how product-centric firms can strive to utilize platform-centric models to compete in the digital age.\nValue Creation through Ag Big Data & Platforms\nThe USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service highlighted several examples of how Big Data can create value in the Agricultural industry including, \u201cincreasing the resilience of production systems; improving understanding of genotype by environmental interactions; and enhancing human and animal health.\u201d The industry is already seeing a competitive edge given to those players who are data focused. This includes a general shift to those who are familiar with technology and platforms in other areas of their life, a shift from supply to a demand-driven industry in which farmers are expected to react quickly to consumer food demands, and a move towards open communication between members of the community.[2]\nJohn Deere saw the opportunity to enter the Big Data space with their platform, MyJohnDeere. In 2012 the company launched several software products that connected John Deere equipment with other machines, owners, operators, dealers and agricultural consultants. This software analyzed individual data through sensors added to the latest John Deere equipment combined with historical data on everything from weather and soil conditions to crop features. This information is shared across stakeholders to help farmers manage their fleet, reduce downtime inefficiencies, and save on fuel costs. [2] Consumers manage all of this information through smart phones, tablets and computers, allowing information to be accessible at all times.\nUtilizing an Open Platform to Capture Value\nIn 2013 John Deere opened their platform to allow input suppliers, agriculture retailers, local agronomists, and software companies to provide applications and software that connect through the platform. A spokesperson for the company said \u201cthese collaborations will greatly benefit our customers by expanding the choices they have to improve productivity, efficiency and yield.\u201d[3]\nMyJohnDeere is free for consumers who purchase John Deere equipment, and from what can be seen from the website it does not look like John Deere is charging 3rd party developers a fee for integrating on their platform (however all applications must be approved by John Deere). While the benefit to the consumer is straightforward, the move towards bringing in 3rd party developers highlights John Deere\u2019s strategy to become a central platform for farm equipment hardware and software. It seems the company has learned about the importance of open systems in winning a platform game, and several other benefits are likely to come out of this:\n- Increase hardware purchases?\u2014?John Deere has seen competition from low-cost competitors, but by integrating a software platform into its products, it can provide a reason for consumers to pay more for its hardware.\n- Prevent hardware multi-homing?\u2014?one of the benefits of MyJohnDeere is connecting all equipment in one software database. Creating this unified platform gives incentives to farmers to purchase all equipment through John Deere instead of through multiple hardware providers.\n- Create barriers for Agriculture Tech companies to enter the space and capture all the value. As we saw in several cases including Nokia and Samsung, when software platforms gain marketplace control, they can push hardware margins down. By being an early mover in this space, John Deere is preventing the emergence of strong Ag Tech companies to become the market power. In fact, John Deere is making these Ag Tech players complementors for its platform instead of competitors.\n- Big Data?\u2014?A big trend in any industry today is whoever owns the data wins. Big Data itself can become a revenue generator and John Deere is likely thinking about how it can utilize the vast data it is gathering in the future.\nThere are hundreds of Ag Tech products out there, but John Deere has shown it has become integral to this space. When developing apps to help farmers in decision-making, Chris Harbourt, chief executive officer of Agrible in Champaign, said the most frequent comments he hears is \u201cI want something that integrates with my John Deere\u2026\u201d[4]\nJohn Deere is not stopping in their quest for agricultural platform dominance.

      "content": "John Deere\u2019s answer to the FTC Right To Repair lawsuit arrived last week in the form of a new digital diagnosis and repair product for John Deere machines and Hagie STS high-clearance sprayers and corn detasselers.\nFor $195 a year for each machine linked in a farmer\u2019s Operations Center account, John Deere says customers in the U.S. and Canada can now \u201cmaintain, diagnose, repair and protect\u201d equipment. A John Deere customer with a large fleet of green and yellow machines can purchase the \u201cEntire Organization Customer Fleet\u201d annual license for $4,995.\nIndependent service technicians are also able to obtain and use Operations Center PRO Service. That license costs $5,995 per year.\nWhat Are Farmers and Precision Ag Experts Saying?\nThe tool is so fresh and new to the market farmers and technicians haven\u2019t had time to put it to use.\nSixth generation Nebraska farmer Lukas Frieke recently switched a good chunk of his on-farm technology and equipment fleet over to John Deere machines. He says its the level of support that his local John Deere dealer is providing that prompted the switch.\nFrieke, who also raises hogs on his farm outside Ulysses, thinks the release of this tool signals a new mindset at the manufacturer.\n\u201cI think Deere realized during the Right to Repair stuff that they need to keep brand loyalty, and one of the biggest issues with the digitization of our equipment lines is the ability to be supported,\u201d Frieke says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is doing the troubleshooting or fixing, it matters that it\u2019s a Deere product.\n\u201cIt also lessens the load on dealership staff \u2014 it allows quality repairs to shine and evens the playing field for all the repair people,\u201d he adds.\nRight to Repair Advocate Speaks\nBeltway lobbyist and long-time Right to Repair advocate Willie Cade says he has the app and plans to spend the next couple weeks putting it through its paces. He cautions farmers to do their homework before they pay the license fees for the new app.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a long history of John Deere making these kinds of promises and not coming through,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really need to get this tool in hand and look through it.\u201d\nCade admits the release signifies a dash of forward progress in the Right to Repair movement, but, in his opinion, John Deere still maintains \u201csome control\u201d over the repair process within PRO Service.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not a free market \u2014 that\u2019s not free at all,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt gives them all the control.\u201d\nCade agrees with Darr at Iowa State: Go dig into the app and figure out what it can and can\u2019t do before you go on social media and give your opinion on it.\n\u201cThen, we can continue the advocacy we\u2019ve been doing for the last seven years,\u201d Cade says. \u201cMaybe the ship is doing a little turn (for the better), but we need to do a full 180.\u201d\nJohn Deere\u2019s Response\nFarm Journal reached out to John Deere to ask more questions beyond what was shared in the initial press release. Denver Caldwell, vice president of aftermarket and customer support for John Deere, provides the following answers:\nFarm Journal: Is the release of PRO Service in response to the FTC v. John Deere and Right to Repair lawsuits?\nCaldwell: The launch of PRO Service is consistent with our long-standing approach to developing new solutions that deliver value for our customers. For many decades, John Deere has steadily expanded its support for customer repairs with technical manuals and evolving into the robust digital offerings that are available today, including: Operations Center, Equipment Mobile, and Shop.Deere.com. John Deere will also continue to develop solutions that enhance customers\u2019 ability to use, maintain, diagnose, repair, and protect their equipment.\nFarm Journal: In previous statements, John Deere representatives have claimed releasing a fully capable digital service tool to customers and independent technicians could potentially compromise and open its machines up to being incorrectly coded or digitally manipulated in some way that would render those machines unsafe or hamper performance. Have those concerns been mitigated in some way within this new tool?\nCaldwell: We\u2019ve developed Operations Center PRO Service to deliver new capabilities for equipment owners to use, maintain, diagnose, repair, and protect their equipment without compromising important factors like safety and regulatory compliance. We will also continue to develop new capabilities and deliver those as they become available.\nFarm Journal: What is the No. 1 aspect of this new service tool that you think is important to convey to farmers who use John Deere equipment?\nCaldwell: Operations Center PRO Service delivers John Deere\u2019s most expansive, innovative, and economical self-repair capabilities yet, and we\u2019re proud of that. New and enhanced features include the ability to install software when replacing electronic components or controllers, also known as reprogramming.\nFarm Journal: Are there any other thoughts you\u2019d like to share about this new tool?\nCaldwell: With thi"
