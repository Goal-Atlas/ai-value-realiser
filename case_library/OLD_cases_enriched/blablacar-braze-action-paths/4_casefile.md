# Case File: BlaBlaCar's AI-Powered Marketing Automation and Personalization

## Executive Summary

BlaBlaCar, the leading community-based travel platform with over 100 million members across 22 global markets, successfully implemented AI-powered marketing automation to address customer journey drop-offs and optimize email engagement. The company leveraged Braze's Canvas Flow platform to create sophisticated abandoned cart campaigns and personalized email strategies that significantly improved conversion rates and operational efficiency.

The implementation focused on two key areas: automated abandoned cart recovery campaigns that targeted high-intent users who began but didn't complete bookings, and personalized email sender optimization that tested various sender name strategies. These initiatives resulted in substantial improvements in both customer engagement and business outcomes, demonstrating the power of AI-driven personalization in the travel and mobility sector.

Key achievements include a 30% increase in bookings through abandoned cart automation, a 48% uplift in click rates, and up to 24% improvement in email open rates through personalized sender names. The platform also enabled increased team productivity by reducing dependency on engineering resources for campaign execution.
