The team wanted to address the leaky funnel with a more cohesive user experience that increased bookings.\nTo create more complex use cases quickly, BlaBlaCar leveraged Canvas Flow to automate cross-channel journeys capable of sending messages at the right time and on the right channels. Embracing experimentation, BlaBlaCar set out to convert high-intent users looking to perform an action by leveraging email, push, Content Cards, in-app messages, and webhooks.\nThe team proved that this program could significantly increase bookings among their target audience. By integrating related content, they increased personalization and their use of Canvas Flow\u2019s experiment path component helped prove that personalized emails can drive more engagement and conversions, compared to non-personalized emails.\nINDUSTRY\nPRODUCTS USED\nBY THE METRICS\n30%\nIncrease in bookings\n48%\nUplift in click rate\nBlaBlaCar is leading the way in community-based travel, with a network that enables over 100 million members to rideshare across 22 global markets. Thanks to the company\u2019s future-forward outlook, the technology they leverage is as practical as it is visionary, connecting members looking to sync up a carpool or travel by bus. Instead of highways clogged with single-passenger vehicles, BlaBlaCar\u2019s environmentally friendly approach saves 1.6 million tons of CO2 annually and drives 120 million human connections annually, proving that travel near and far can become a more affordable, convenient, and convivial experience for passengers and drivers everywhere.\nWhen many marketing teams are looking to make the most of their investments and do more with less, Braze Canvas Flow has enabled BlaBlaCar to reach more of their customers at scale and increase team productivity. This feature can help drive financial KPIs, and its advanced automation can help teams cut back on back and forth with engineering and data teams, leading to more iterative and impactful campaigns overall. One of the many ways BlaBlaCar is leading the charge is by innovating both on the road and in its customer engagement strategy.\nTaking a Visionary Approach to Maximize Revenue With Customer Engagement\nFor BlaBlaCar users, trust is everything. Customers need to know BlaBlaCar is there for them when they travel, and one way to keep the brand top-of-mind for its users is via customer engagement. By actively accompanying users at every step of the lifecycle, BlaBlaCar\u2019s marketing team works to build lasting customer relationships that lead to increased brand loyalty and repeat business.\nFinding a partner for their customer engagement led them to Braze in 2017. Before adopting Braze, BlaBlaCar used an internal tool focused on email that couldn\u2019t send push and wasn\u2019t able to effectively support cross-channel campaigns. That tool\u2019s manual features made it challenging to manage customer journeys across email and push, and hurt the company\u2019s ability to target specific segments. As the company adopted an app-first strategy, these limitations necessitated the migration to Braze. Built with first-party streaming data, Braze was architected to help the brand make the most of every lifecycle stage, from activation to onboarding and retention.\nThe ability to target specific use cases and audience segments came in especially handy when the team set out to address their abandoned cart needs. BlaBlaCar decided to leverage Canvas Flow, our customer journey orchestration tool, to build out a holistic, impactful abandoned cart program that was capable of closing this key gap.\nBuilding a Successful Abandoned Cart Strategy, Step by Step\nWith Braze, BlaBlaCar could successfully create an abandoned cart program exactly as they imagined. That meant building in rich personalization, A/B testing, custom event properties, and razor-precision automation to optimize send time and delivery.\nTheir Strategy:\n1. When BlaBlaCar noticed a cohort of users were searching for a solution to their travel needs but then leaving before they completed the booking process, the company realized it was time to close the gap. Just like retailers who drive results by prioritizing abandoned carts, BlaBlaCar identified this audience set as a high priority to reach and nudge them to finalize their booking.\n2. The team aligned on a channel mix that they planned to use to encourage users to return to their booking. This mix included email, push notifications, and some thoughtfully-deployed webhooks.\n3. With Braze as their partner, BlaBlaCar\u2019s product and marketing teams could leverage Canvas Flow, an intuitive customer journey builder that enables easy orchestration and execution. Its drag-and-drop interface and seamless integrations make it easy to compo"

To get where you need to be, there are a few hurdles you have to navigate. A pressing need to evolve beyond gut intuition. An urgency to establish (and stick to) a testing strategy. And, finally, work need to ensure you\u2019ve made room for reflection and the effective measurement of your efforts\u2019 impact.\nHow do you get there? Well, take a page from French carpooling platform BlaBlaCar. This forward-looking brand, which has 65 million registered drivers and passengers across 22 countries connecting via its website and app to coordinate car journeys, was looking to optimize its email marketing and the way they went about it didn\u2019t just boost their open rate by 20+%\u2014it set down a clear roadmap for how other brands can achieve the same kinds of results.\nStep One: Define Your Marketing Objective\nFor BlaBlaCar, their optimization process began with a clear goal. The company wanted to reach its customers as effectively as possible via email while also maximizing its email open rates. BlaBlaCar\u2019s clarity about what metrics mattered for its business and where it wanted to see improvement made it easier for its marketers to determine where to focus (and, eventually, what to test).\nStep Two: Create a Marketing Hypothesis\nOnce BlaBlaCar determined what they were looking to achieve, the next step the company took was to identify a hunch\u2014or, in this case, two hunches\u2014that they wanted to test.\n- Hunch #1: That email recipients would be more likely to open a message that was listed as coming from a person\u2019s name\n- Hunch #2: That different types of sender names would perform better in different countries.\n\u201cWe had a strong intuition that personalized sender names\u2014that is, a name displayed as sender on the email preview\u2014would increase our open rates,\u201d explains Fanny Argoud of BlaBlaCar. \u201cWe wanted to determine: If this assumption is true, in other words, if we compare a version with a sender name and a version with only \u2018BlaBlaCar\u2019 as [the] sender name, would we see a significant difference in opens? If that is the case, what would the best sender name be?\u201d\nStep Three: Carrying Out the Experiment\nIn order to automate and simplify the process of testing the two hypotheses, BlaBlaCar turned to Braze Canvas. This visual customer journey tool is designed to make it easy for marketers to conceptualize their campaigns and to seamlessly coordinate targeted, personalized messages across channels. For BlaBlaCar, it made it possible to build out testing flows that supported several rounds of related experiments in two of its markets\u2014France and Russia\u2014over the course of two months. These experiments were built around A/B tests comparing several sender name variants, including:\n- \u201cBlaBlaCar\u201d as the sender name vs. a first-person name (e.g. \u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJane\u201d) as the sender name\n- A common first name in a given country vs. a rare name in a given country\n- A perceived masculine name vs. a name perceived as feminine\nStep Four: Assessing the Results\nDid sender name have a measurable impact on engagement with BlaBlaCar\u2019s email program? As it turns out, yes. In fact, the brand discovered that sending emails with the first names of real people resulted in 20+% higher open rates for their messages, compared to emails sent from \u201cBlaBlaCar.\u201d In addition, the company\u2019s hypothesis that gender and name popularity would impact email open rates also proved to be true, with a popular masculine name proving to be most popular both in Russia and France.\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of their campaign open rates broken out by country and sender name variant:\nAnd while not every test leads to concrete action, this one has: BlaBlaCar has implemented the learnings from this experiment by switching all of their French email marketing campaigns to be sent from the sender name \u201cJulien\u201d and is working on a similar rollout in other countries.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile this experiment from BlaBlaCar looked at metrics important to the top of the funnel (specifically email open rates), there\u2019s no reason that other brands can\u2019t use their success as a jumping off point to dig deeper into email message testing. For instance, your brand could take a similar campaign and measure the impact that the use of different sender names has on downstream metrics\u2014maybe sending messages with a given name or type of name ends up being associated with stronger or weaker retention a week or a month out.\nThe key thing is this: A lot of components can influence the overall success of an email marketing campaign and you need to be mindful of all them. What marketers may take for granted\u2014such as sending emails from the brand name because that\u2019s what\u2019s always been done\u2014may be affecting customer engagement in ways you may not ev"

      "content": "AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog\nTransforming the Customer Experience at Speed and Scale with AWS and Braze\nBy Jon Hyman, Co-Founder and CTO at Braze\nBraze is a comprehensive customer engagement platform built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps brands bring modern, stream processing, and data-science frameworks to their engagement strategies. In 2019, Braze sent more than 600 billion personalized emails, push notifications, in-app messages, SMS messages, and more to billions of monthly active users.\nBraze\u2019s customer engagement platform is built for today\u2019s on-demand, always-connected customers. We replace decades-old databases and poorly integrated internal and external tools with live views of every customer, highly intuitive customer journey building, in-the-moment campaign optimization, and more.\nWhen building Braze, we chose AWS primarily because of its elasticity. We cycle through more than 10,000 servers each week; one moment we may have a period of low traffic volume, and the next we need to send 50 million emails. AWS helps us handle that type of dynamism, ensuring we always have the processing power and scale we need.\nThe importance of speed at scale cannot be overestimated as consumers\u2019 expectations for on-demand, hyper-personalized communications continue to increase.\nWhen a minute can make or break an experience, brands need a customer engagement ecosystem that allows them to make virtually instantaneous and meaningful connections with every one of their customers in real-time.\nNamed to the Forbes Cloud 100 List each of the past two years, Braze is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner with AWS Competencies in both Retail and Digital Customer Experience.\nTo demonstrate how Braze plus AWS equates to real-world success, let\u2019s examine recent campaigns from our customers and the technology that made them possible.\nBurger King: Billions Swerved\nIn the highly competitive quick-service restaurant (QSR) landscape, it takes more than a free burger to compel a customer.\nIn order to succeed, the best brands are using sophisticated technology ecosystems to facilitate creative ways of capturing consumer attention. In 2019, Burger King made headlines\u2014and increased revenue\u2014with its award-winning Whopper Detour campaign.\nThe Campaign\nPlaying on a legendary rivalry, Burger King offered one-cent Whoppers to customers, but only if they opened the Burger King app within 600 feet of a McDonald\u2019s. The offer also had to be redeemed within the hour.\nThe Technology\nBurger King chose Braze because we have great interoperability with other parts of the marketing technology ecosystem, including: mParticle for customer data management; Branch for deep linking; Amplitude to provide behavioral data analysis; Accuweather for monitoring contextual location conditions; and Radar for location targeting and geofencing. These integrations enable our customers to provide a much richer consumer experience.\nHere\u2019s what that looked like for consumers (and a brief look behind the scenes) of the Whopper Detour:\n- When a customer with the app came within 600 feet of a geofenced McDonald\u2019s, location data infrastructure Radar sent the location data as an event to mParticle, a customer data platform (CDP).\n- This location event was then sent from mParticle to Braze, triggering a push notification followed by an in-app message.\n- After clicking on the push notification, Burger King customers were taken to an order screen, and then directed to the nearest Burger King.\nOnce someone entered the geofenced area, the event was sent to one of hundreds of Braze API servers on AWS. On average, Braze receives more than 8 billion API calls each day and processes each request in under 100 milliseconds. That\u2019s because Braze relies on AWS Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing.\nThe Braze platform\u2019s processing speed is crucial to the success of this campaign. If we were even a minute late receiving and processing that geofence location, the consumer experience would have been terrible. Part of the excitement is getting the push notification the moment you get close to a McDonald\u2019s.\nThe campaign generated 3.2 million new app downloads, which skyrocketed the Burger King app to number one in the App Store, as well as boosting monthly active users (MAUs) by 54 percent. It also drove $15 million in additional revenue from the participating customers.\nBehind the scenes, brands running seamless customer engagement efforts like these can do so with confidence because they\u2019ve invested in modern technology stacks with highly specialized solutions. This hybrid stack built with best-in-class components allowed Burger King to unleash its powerful creativity.\nOverstock: The Power of Cross-Channel Personalization\nMany brands still rely on batch-and-blast messaging that is disconnected from their users\u2019 unique interests and preferences. That\u2019s because many companies struggle to understand an increasing amount of data and personalization at scale. Tod"
