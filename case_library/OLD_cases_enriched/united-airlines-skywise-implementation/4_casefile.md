# Case File: United Airlines' Skywise Implementation

## Executive Summary

United Airlines has partnered with Airbus to implement Skywise, an open-data platform designed to enhance aircraft maintenance and engineering operations through advanced data analytics and machine learning. The platform integrates with United's existing Palantir Foundry system to provide comprehensive data management capabilities across their Airbus fleet.

Skywise consolidates multiple technology elements including data warehousing, visualization, alerting, and machine learning packages into a single platform, enabling airlines to develop and deploy analytical products more efficiently. The implementation aims to maximize fleet performance through data-driven insights and continuous operational improvements, while also providing benchmarking capabilities against other airline users' trends.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Data Management Efficiency (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
