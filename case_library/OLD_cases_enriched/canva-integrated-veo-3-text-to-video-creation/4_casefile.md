# Case File: Canva's Integration of Google Veo 3 for Text-to-Video Creation

## Executive Summary

Canva has integrated Google's Veo 3 AI video generation model into its platform through a new feature called "Create a Video Clip." This integration allows users to generate 8-second video clips with synchronized audio using simple text prompts. The feature is available to Canva's paid subscribers (Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Nonprofits) with an initial limit of five video generations per month.

The integration represents a significant democratization of AI video creation technology, making cinematic-quality video generation accessible to millions of users without requiring specialized skills or expensive software. This move is part of Canva's multi-model AI strategy to consolidate creative tools within a single platform workflow.

**Key Findings:**
- 9 out of 11 claims approved as well-supported
- 2 claims flagged for review due to potentially hyperbolic language
- Strong evidence for democratization and accessibility benefits
- Clear documentation of technical capabilities and limitations
