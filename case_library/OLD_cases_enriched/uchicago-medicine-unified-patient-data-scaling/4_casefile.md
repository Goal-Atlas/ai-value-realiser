# UChicago Medicine: Unified Patient Data and Scaling Initiative

## Executive Summary

UChicago Medicine has undertaken a comprehensive data transformation initiative focused on democratizing healthcare data access and scaling patient support operations. The health system established an ADAMS Center in partnership with MDClone to enable self-service data access for clinicians and researchers, eliminating traditional bottlenecks in data requests. Concurrently, they implemented Salesforce's Agentforce for Health to automate routine patient interactions and support tasks. This multi-pronged approach aims to accelerate research, improve care delivery, and enhance operational efficiency while allowing staff to focus on high-value patient interactions.

The initiative has already demonstrated concrete results, including a retired physician identifying 586 patients requiring improved blood pressure management through self-service data exploration. The transformation represents a shift from traditional IT-mediated data requests to immediate, self-service access using synthetic data for privacy protection.
