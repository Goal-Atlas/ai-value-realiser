# Case File: Kraft Heinz AI Platform Deployment and Process Automation

## Executive Summary

Kraft Heinz has implemented a comprehensive AI strategy focused on democratizing access to artificial intelligence across its global workforce while optimizing key operational processes. The company's flagship AI engine, KHAI, was deployed to 13,000 team members globally within 180 days, demonstrating rapid enterprise-scale AI adoption. The platform serves as a secure, internal AI tool that enables employees to analyze documents, optimize factory procedures, and access standard operating procedures without compromising data security.

Beyond workforce augmentation, Kraft Heinz has leveraged AI to streamline critical business processes including SAP rollouts in China and routine financial automation. The company has also developed specialized AI agents like The Cookbook, which provides workers access to 150 years of ketchup production expertise and went from concept to prototype in under three months. These initiatives represent a systematic approach to AI integration that focuses on enhancing existing operational capabilities rather than transforming the core business model.
