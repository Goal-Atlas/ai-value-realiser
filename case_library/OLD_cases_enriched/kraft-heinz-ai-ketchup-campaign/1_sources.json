      "content": "Enterprises are honing their approach to identifying the right AI use cases \u2014 and demonstrating the accompanying business value.\nFor Kraft Heinz, the success of an initiative is measured by a mix of quantitative and qualitative assessments, according to Pat Nestor, head of decision intelligence products and platforms at the food and beverage giant.\n\u201cOn the quantitative side, that\u2019s where the business case assessment comes in,\u201d Nestor told CIO Dive. Teams need to be able to tie use cases to broader business goals, like boosting sales or reducing costs.\nThe quantitative assessment is paired with qualitative value, such as impacts on its net promoter score and adoption levels.\n\u201cWe measure and track NPS, adoption and engagement scores to provide a healthy feedback loop for us to then refine and evolve,\u201d Nestor said. \u201cThat qualitative-quantitative balance is something that we really focus on here.\u201d\nWith more C-suite, investor and board-level focus on AI and bigger budgets supporting the efforts, technology leaders are under pressure to get the formula right, from picking a scalable, beneficial use case to tracking its success post-deployment.\nAI project failure rates are up this year as enterprises grapple with a battery of deterrents. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 of businesses have struggled to demonstrate generative AI\u2019s business value, according to an Informatica report published in February.\nSuccessful enterprises often credit use case alignment with broader strategic goals to support project prioritization and taking into consideration available resources and expected timelines.\n\u201cOne of the most important things for us, from my vantage point, is that we do not view AI, or particularly generative AI, as a solution in and of itself, but rather as a critical ingredient that can allow us to supercharge a larger program,\u201d Nestor said.\nBefore Kraft Heinz chooses where to make a big AI bet, there\u2019s an upfront effort to pressure test use cases. This is also the stage where success criteria are established and mock-ups are created.\nNestor said teams try to initially answer the following questions:\n- Where does the company want the use case to go?\n- How could it potentially evolve?\n- How will it be measured?\n- How can we evaluate progress along the way?\n\u201cThat assessment activity high funnel is critically important so that we have a well-rounded idea and a well-rounded business case before we actually commit material resources,\u201d Nestor said.\nAn unsuccessful experiment or pilot phase, however, isn\u2019t the end of the world, according to Nestor. Learning from failure is part of any innovation process.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that you have to expect and accept some level of failure,\u201d Nestor said. \u201cYou need to have an innovation funnel, not an innovation tunnel.\u201d\nDipping into AI\nEarlier in the year, Kraft Heinz reorganized its technology governance structure. The company brought data, digital and IT under one global technology umbrella and the company\u2019s global CIO, Corrado Azzarita.\nAs part of the restructuring, Nestor was tapped to lead a newly formed decision intelligence products and platforms team, moving from his previous role as global head of product at Kraft Heinz.\n\u201cFundamentally, that is our data to AI value chain organization, so all facets and sub-teams that sit within that are part of the decision intelligence portfolio,\u201d Nestor said. The team also manages the platforms and products within the domain.\nThe reorg coincides with broader strategy shifts as the company grapples with six consecutive quarters of total revenue decline, Food Dive reported last month. Kraft Heinz is eyeing a number of levers to turn around the sales decline, such as unlocking efficiencies and improving productivity.\nTo meet those goals, Kraft Heinz leaned into its strategic technology partners, which include Microsoft as part of a digital twin effort in manufacturing and Snowflake for its data management infrastructure and as the foundation platform for its internal AI engine, KHAI.\nKHAI took about 180 days from idea to launch, and is now in the hands of about 13,000 team members globally, according to Nestor. The company wanted to democratize generative AI access without sacrificing security. The AI engine was built internally and architected to provide a \u201cone-way door.\u201d\n\u201cThe wealth of information that KHAI is trained on and the underlying LLMs are trained on can still come in, but when our team members interact with the tool and upload Kraft Heinz internal information, it cannot go out,\u201d Nestor said.\nTeam members use the platform to analyze and summarize documents or dense industry reports, as well as to optimize and access standard operating procedures on a factory floor. The engine also helped streamline SAP rollouts in China and automate routine financials. Nestor said he has the platform bookmarked in his browser and uses it on a daily basis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really becoming an integral part of a variety of workflows,\u201d Nestor said, adding he expects the numb"

      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- Kraft Heinz is piloting an AI agent to help employees better access information about the company\u2019s ketchup production process, with plans for more use cases down the line.\n- The tool, called The Cookbook, went from idea to prototype in fewer than three months, the company told CIO Dive. It was created in partnership with Microsoft and built using Azure OpenAI. Workers have access to 150 years of Kraft Heinz expertise in ketchup production.\n- \u201cWith the stroke of a keyboard or tap on a tablet, users will be able to ask The Cookbook questions on everything from the thickness and color of a batch of Heinz Tomato Ketchup to insights about the efficiency of our production processes,\u201d the company said. The Cookbook is still in the early stages, with just a select group of U.S. team members having access. The company declined to say how many.\nDive Insight:\nKraft Heinz is adding an agent to its AI portfolio in pursuit of efficiency and knowledge preservation. Prior to The Cookbook, the company launched TasteMaker, which was designed to accelerate product development and marketing.\n\u201cThis is not the first AI agent to be deployed at Kraft Heinz,\u201d Pat Nestor, head of decision intelligence products and platforms, said in an email to CIO Dive. \u201cWe continue to explore integrated AI solutions that can drive scalability and connectivity across the organization, unlocking further value for the business, our people and consumers.\u201d\nThe new tool comes after the global food and beverage giant has honed its innovation funnel, driven in part by efforts to identify the right use cases and formulate business value assessments to track success.\nNestor told CIO Dive earlier this year that the company works to pressure test use cases upfront and monitors AI projects using a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The process helps ensure allocated resources are going to the right use cases and avoid dead-end projects that are plaguing businesses across the economy.\nThis year, 42% of companies are abandoning the majority of their AI projects, up from 17% in 2024, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report published in March. CIOs and their enterprises often grapple with connecting use cases to business goals, sifting through vendor hype and failing to prioritize responsible practices, among other implementation challenges.\nKraft Heinz executives have touted a number of beneficial, worker-facing AI use cases, such as within the pickle-producing process and across its supply chain.\n\u201cWe aim to use key learnings and insights from The Cookbook pilot to scale to other brands, products, and Kraft Heinz businesses, and we are currently in the process of exploring additional use cases for the technology,\u201d Nestor said Tuesday. \u201cWe know it\u2019s essential that we preserve and protect our subject matter experts\u2019 knowledge and commitment to quality.\u201d\nDespite the AI inroads, significant changes lie ahead for Kraft Heinz.\nThe food and beverage giant is planning to reverse much of its $46 billion merger from 2015 and split into two companies, with one focusing on sauces, spreads and seasonings, and another housing grocery staples, such as Lunchables and Oscar Mayer. Splits and mergers often include technology hurdles, from migrating workloads to untangling tech debt.\nThe company has run up against many of the same challenges that others in the industry face, including changing consumer patterns and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In general, the focus on technology has sharpened in the wake of the turmoil as businesses pursue ways to alleviate pressure.\n\u201cOur investments in technology, particularly in AI, have transformed our ways of working,\u201d CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera said during the company\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call in July. \u201cFrom improving demand forecasting to optimizing factory floor processes, we are driving end-to-end improvement.\u201d"
