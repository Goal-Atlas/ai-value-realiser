# Case File: Bricorama's AI-Powered Paint Shopping Assistant

## Executive Summary

Bricorama, a French DIY retailer, partnered with Accenture to develop pAInt, a generative AI-powered shopping assistant designed to help customers with their painting projects. Built on Azure OpenAI Service and trained on Bricorama's proprietary content, the platform provides personalized advice on paint colors, quantities, and accessories while integrating directly with the company's e-commerce systems.

The pAInt platform was positioned as a way to enhance customer experience by providing expert guidance throughout the DIY painting process, from inspiration to implementation. However, the service has since been discontinued indefinitely, raising questions about the long-term viability and effectiveness of the implementation.

- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: The pAInt platform saves customers time, effort and money
- **Evidence**: "Named pAInt, this gen AI shopping assistant saves time, effort and money."

- **Evidence**: "For Bricorama, pAInt is supporting its goal to reposition its brand as the DIY champion of home improvement projects for French consumers."

- **Evidence**: "pAInt has also showcased the potential for generative AI to enhance the customer experience and provide valuable guidance in unique decision-making processes."

- **Claim**: pAInt enables Bricorama to offer customers a unique online experience
- **Evidence**: "Ce nouveau service permet à l'enseigne d'offrir à ses clients une expérience unique en ligne et de les accompagner dans la réussite de leurs projets « Do It Yourself »."
- **Source**: S2
