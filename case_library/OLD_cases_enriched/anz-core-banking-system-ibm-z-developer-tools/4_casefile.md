# ANZ Core Banking System - IBM Z Developer Tools Implementation

## Executive Summary

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), one of Australia's top-five banks, implemented a comprehensive mainframe modernization initiative using IBM zSystems technology to enhance their core banking infrastructure. The project focused on improving disaster recovery capabilities, backup performance, and overall system resilience to serve their extensive customer base of over 8.5 million users. ANZ's approach centered on building inter-site resiliency capacity through mirrored IBM zSystems servers, enabling faster disaster recovery and more timely mainframe backups while maintaining high availability standards required for critical banking operations.
