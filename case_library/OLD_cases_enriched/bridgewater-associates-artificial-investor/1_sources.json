      "content": "- Bridgewater is planning to launch a fund next July that will be driven by AI.\n- The fund's AIA Labs is working to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning.\n- The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outline how they're going to do it.\nBridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, is building a machine-learning engine to predict global economic events and invest clients' money accordingly.\nThe Westport, Connecticut-based hedge fund plans to launch a fund on July 1 that will combine various AI models to make investments on behalf of a few clients, Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer, Greg Jensen, told Business Insider in an interview.\nThe efforts have been led by a new group at Bridgewater, called the Artificial Investment Associate (AIA) Labs. It's made up of 20 investors and machine-learning scientists on the mission \"to do everything that we do via machine-learning techniques,\" Jensen said.\nFor Bridgewater, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, that means replicating every step of the investment process with AI and machine learning, from understanding global financial and economic patterns, to creating investment theories, and plugging those theories into machine-learning models to check if the theories are accurate or not. Risk controls and oversight will still be in the hands of humans, Jensen said, and there will be a kill switch if there's ever a need to turn it off.\nJensen will have oversight over the fund. But the rest, from idea generation to testing and the models used to make trades, will all be developed through AI and machine learning.\nThis is a first for Bridgewater, which started building the fund via AIA Labs about a year ago. Bridgewater certainly isn't the first hedge fund to try and get AI to beat the markets, but funds that have tried have had lackluster results. One challenge is doing so requires a lot of data, of which there isn't a lot when it comes to major economic cycles, Jensen said, and you need the future to behave like the past, which also isn't a guarantee.\nBridgewater's so-called \"artificial investor\" is exceeding expectations by making solid predictions about what's next for the euro, or what's next for inflation, Jensen said. And once the fund launches, Jensen is hoping the AI investor will get \"much more powerful\" as a \"loop of learning\" mints more data.\n\"In some sense, I feel we've been able to create the bones of something that will be more than the sum of its parts,\" Jensen said. \"We won't describe specifics, but I do expect we will be able to generate a unique source of alpha that is designed to have both high returns and is uncorrelated to markets and other sources of alpha.\"\nBridgewater aims to launch the fund with a few initial partners, \"each with strong commitments to learning alongside us as the technology advances and our approach progresses in parallel,\" Jensen said. The firm declined to disclose how much seed capital it will start with.\nInside AIA Labs\nAIA Labs will play a critical role as Bridgewater looks to transform itself with AI. The venture is led by Jasjeet Sekhon, who is the chief scientist of the hedge fund.\nSekhon came to Bridgewater in 2018 after a life in academia, where he taught machine learning at Harvard, UC Berkeley, Yale. His specialization is in causal inference, or the study of finding out what caused something to occur in the world. Sekhon applies machine learning to analyze Bridgewater's reams of data from the past to predict what will happen in the future.\nAt AIA Labs, much of the work is focused on combining statistical models with language models. The latter can forming sentences and are key to creating investment theories, but what language models aren't so good at is ensuring that what it's saying is true. That's where the statistical models come in, they can help determine whether the theories are true or not. And now, AI language models have progressed to the point where humans can interrogate and probe them, much in the same way people talk to each other through language, Sekhon said.\n\"It's really that this moment is the integration of language models, with the type of time-series models Jas has been working on a long time, combined with how far \u2014 in part by our own pushing \u2014 but how far diagnostic tools have come to understanding machine learning algorithms,\" Jensen said. \"Those pieces coming together is what has made this point so incredibly special.\"\nBut there are still technical and regulatory hurdles that Bridgewater will need to overcome before the fund can launch.\n\"Markets are extremely difficult, so I don't want to overstate how well this will work,\" Jensen said. That said, \"it's good enough that I would stamp it as a good return stream,\" he added."

      "content": "While AI-related investment isn\u2019t yet a major driver of economic growth, it looks poised to rise rapidly from here\u2014with the potential to shape the business cycle well before AI is in widespread productive use. It may feel like a bubble now (and there are some frothy aspects), but we are likely still in the very early innings.\nAt some points in history, we experience a technological breakthrough big enough to change the way that we go about our day-to-day lives. In most cases, it takes many years for society to adapt to the new technology and to figure out how to reap its benefits. However, the combination of excitement around its potential benefits and fears of becoming obsolete can spark intense competition to get ahead. That competition can pull forward the expected future growth associated with the technology by creating a surge in investment in the near term.\nWe believe AI is likely on that path. We have been studying AI for over a decade, both as macro investors interested in its possible economic impacts and as users of machine-learning techniques (and, for a few of us, as individual investors in the space). Since the release of ChatGPT in the fall of 2022, the technology has captured the imagination of society\u2014and, while its ultimate impact on the economy remains highly uncertain, it may boost productivity across many industries in truly staggering ways.\nToday, the ingredients are in place for an arms race to build capability in AI. In investment management, the race is on. Over the next decade, investors who most effectively harness the strengths of machine learning and navigate its weaknesses will likely build sizable economic moats. This is likely true across most industries; as that becomes increasingly clear, spending on AI will accelerate. Already, the technology is an existential concern for some of the world\u2019s most cash-rich companies (mostly in tech), and some of the largest pools of capital are jockeying to capture its future benefits. Over the next two years or so, we expect that new entrants will use ML techniques to disrupt several established industries, likely prompting another wave of investment far beyond the tech industry.\nEven if the productivity gains for the average company are years in the future, the spending to get there could have material implications for growth and corporate profits in the near term. To appreciate the possible magnitude of this investment, consider: how much will people with cumulative access to trillions of dollars invest if they believe their companies are at existential risk? How much capital will become available if investors believe a new technology has almost unlimited possible future value? It will not take many players to feel that way for the resulting investment to have major economic ripples. Indeed, investment around the adoption of computers and the internet\u2014the last major period of investment to integrate a general-purpose technology\u2014was an important driver of growth in the \u201990s. If anything, the concentration of AI investment among a few very cash-rich players means that it could ramp up faster and with less of a connection to realized productivity gains than investment did then.\nOf course, nothing is certain yet, and we continue to track the market pricing and cash flow expectations of the key players across the exposed supply chains. Notwithstanding some pockets of froth, the classic boom dynamic of abundant capital chasing far-out returns has yet to take off: affected firms\u2019 equity prices are mostly moving in line with near-term expected profits at reasonable or only slightly stretched multiples. But when we look at the underlying dynamics, we see the makings of a surge in spending that could be large enough to shape the trajectory of the business cycle from here.\nIn the rest of this report, we explore these dynamics in greater depth and take stock of where they stand today.\nInvestment to Adopt General-Purpose Technologies Can Drive the Business Cycle\nLike past general-purpose technologies, the widespread adoption of AI across the economy would require the build-out of an extensive infrastructure to support it. The diagram below provides a simplified sketch of the flow of AI-related spending through the relevant supply chains, noting where some high-profile companies fit in.\nThere is a very wide range of possibilities for how much investment will ultimately occur across these supply chains. We are still in the early innings of adoption: core models have limited utility on their own, and people will need to figure out and build effective applications of the technology before it can add value across a wide range of industries. In the long run, the magnitude of investment will depend on the evolution of highly uncertain variables, such as the speed of adoption of the technology, the degree of AI use across the economy, the size of large language models, industry concentration (e.g., does everyone use just a few models or will many models be t"
