Using digital technology to reach people where they are has helped them see massive growth.\n3-MINUTE READ\n11.1M\nnew customers in 2023\n65%\nof those new customers were acquired through digital channels\n100%\ngrowth in digital sales during the last four years\nSince its founding in 1857, BBVA has sought to stay ahead of the times with forward-thinking innovations. In recent years, they\u2019ve focused heavily on investments in cloud, data and AI to create a data-driven, engaging and differentiated customer experience.\nThis approach has led to significant growth in new customers and revenue, as well as improved efficiency and profitability. The company realized a staggering 117% growth in new customers in the last five years and posted a profit of \u20ac8.02B in 2023, the highest earnings in its history.\nAs part of its ongoing reinvention journey, BBVA partnered with Accenture to develop a new, comprehensive digital sales model. The result? Nearly 50 million customers now interact with the bank through digital channels, and seven out of 10 sales are made digitally. BBVA\u2019s client onboarding process takes just minutes (versus a few days at most other banks), using AI-based facial recognition and text analytics to verify account applicants via mobile app and real-time connections to external data sources to detect fraud.\nThese results would not have been possible had the bank not consistently invested in its digital core, harnessing the power of cloud, data and AI to facilitate the rapid development of new capabilities and insights. For example, bank-wide data, predictive analytics and business intelligence deliver a holistic view of the current and lifetime profitability\u2014and likely behavior\u2014of every customer. BBVA is also using Amazon Web Services to create a new global data platform to provide all business units with a unified view of their data and access to more efficient data processing, analysis and insights.\nBy combining first-party data with new data sources to deliver a step-by-step view of the customer journey, BBVA\u2019s new digital sales model helps the bank prioritize sales initiatives for new customers and cross-sell to existing customers. The new model incorporates strategy and planning, paid media, search engine optimization, marketing automation, analytics, and content production for BBVA\u2019s digital channels to reach individuals in hyper-personalized ways.\nBBVA\u2019s reinvented sales model is having a massive, positive impact\u2014including a cost-to-income ratio of 41.7%, one of the best among European banks. It\u2019s also helping the bank expand its footprint in specific countries and regions. For instance, in Italy, BBVA opened in new markets with a full digital value proposition that inspired 130,000 new customers to join in the first year alone\u2014a figure which has risen to more than 450,000 in the time since.\nToday, with the tools and talent to support continuous reinvention, BBVA can continue to reimagine what\u2019s possible, driving breakthrough experiences that attract and delight customers and add real value.\nAcross industries and markets, reinvention is redefining what\u2019s possible\u2014powering growth, sparking innovation and delivering measurable impact."

      "content": "BBVA often talks about how it is transitioning from a bank into a truly digital company. While it is an easy thing to say, the ways in which you demonstrate this are incredibly complex. Take data, for example.\nData is rightly seen as one of the key drivers of a truly digital business. In many ways it is the \u00e2oil\u00e2 that not only fuels the business, but that keeps its progress smooth and that can be transformed into a myriad of growth-promoting products and services.\nFor BBVA the quantity of data the business collects and stores - both its own proprietary data and the data it looks after for its customers and clients - is growing exponentially every year.\nBut the challenge, and more accurately the opportunity, comes not from the gathering and storing, but rather from how insight is derived from that data - how it is put to good use. This element falls into a category now frequently referred to as Data Science - and it\u00e2s an area where BBVA is gaining recognition as a leader and expert in the field.\nThree members of the bank\u00e2s Data & Analytics team (D&A), including former CEO and founder Elena Alfaro, recently co-authored a case study alongside research scientists from the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US and the University of Queensland Business School in Australia.\nThe focus of the paper, titled: \u00e2BBVA Fuels Digital Transformation Progress with a Data Science Center of Excellence\u00e2 was to examine the establishment in 2014 by BBVA of a dedicated data science unit within the bank, and to analyse its operations, rationale, drivers and outputs, with a view to informing other businesses about what success in this area looks like.\nA separate unit\nThe first point the authors of the paper note is that four-years-ago and from the outset, the bank established its Data & Analytics unit as a distinct and separate business designed to generate value for the bank using data science, and which had a further, important, result.\nThe report states: \u00e2The center of excellence was physically and structurally separated from the bank, which helped the Center of Excellence (CoE)\u00c2 nurture and retain unique kinds of talent, initiate innovative data monetization projects and partnerships, and balance short-term and long-term BBVA demands. The CoE activities influenced BBVA\u00e2s data culture and laid the groundwork for a BBVA Data Office, reporting to the CEO, which was put in place in late 2017 to recognize data as a core BBVA competency.\u00e2\nThe cultural element was critical to the success of the venture, because with so many businesses trying to recruit from the same limited data science pool, the need to differentiate yourself is hugely important.\nThe report adds: \u00e2The space was a key component of D&A\u00e2s talent strategy because its data scientists valued a \u00e2Silicon Valley\u00e2- like working environment that fostered shared responsibilities, analytical challenges, and flexible work arrangements.\n\u00e2Many of the data scientists who joined the new company came from academia or had taken part in one of the BBVA innovation experiments. Hiring each data scientist took three to six months.\u00e2\nHowever once the program of recruitment was underway, and it was clear that this unit was operating less like a bank and more like a tech business, the ability of BBVA to recruit - and critically to retain - really took off. The report notes that between 2014 and 2017, the D&A team grew from six to fifty people, one-third of whom were female, while only six people left.\nFrom an operational perspective, one of the interesting insights that Alfaro highlights in the case study is the steps D&A took to grow both its customer base and reputation.\nWhile the market for the new division\u00e2s services was clear and growing within BBVA, there was also a requirement - and indeed a huge benefit - to be derived from delivering insight in areas of the bank where monetization of the work was not the intent.\nThe report notes how social good projects not only helped build out new capabilities in the team, and helped the recruitment program, but also showed BBVA as a responsible business and trusted provider of analytic solutions.\nOne such highlighted project involved the aftermath of Hurricane Odile, which struck the Mexican west coast in September 2014.\nThe team analyzed the ATM and point of sale transactions of more than 100,000 BBVA Bancomer customers in the aftermath of the storm - roughly a 30 percent of Mexican bank account holders in this area - to develop activity and behavior models.\nThese models were designed to then be subsequently used by disaster planners for future emergencies providing insight into what people do before, during and after a natural disaster, enabling correct resources to be put in place and ultimately ease suffering and safeguard lives.\nAnother area highlighted was where Data & Analytics added valuable insight to the business around adding customer value to existing BBVA core products an"
