# Case File: BBVA's Digital Customer Acquisition and Sales Optimization

## Executive Summary

BBVA has successfully transformed its customer acquisition and sales processes through comprehensive digital optimization, partnering with Accenture to become one of the world's most customer-centric banks. The Spanish banking giant leveraged cloud computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence to dramatically improve operational efficiency and customer experience.

The bank's digital transformation has yielded remarkable results, including 11.1 million new customers in 2023 with 65% acquired through digital channels, and 100% growth in digital sales over four years. BBVA now serves nearly 50 million customers through digital channels, with 70% of all sales conducted digitally. The optimization of core banking processes has reduced client onboarding from days to minutes and achieved a cost-to-income ratio of 41.7%, among the best in European banking.

These achievements demonstrate how traditional financial institutions can optimize existing capabilities through digital transformation, improving efficiency, customer experience, and competitive positioning without fundamentally altering their core business model.
