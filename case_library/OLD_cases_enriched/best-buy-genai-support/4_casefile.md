# Case File: Best Buy's GenAI Customer Support Enhancement

## Executive Summary

Best Buy has partnered with Accenture and Google to implement comprehensive generative AI solutions across their customer support operations. The initiative includes an AI-powered virtual assistant for customer self-service and advanced AI tools that augment human agents' capabilities in real-time customer interactions.

The implementation spans multiple touchpoints including BestBuy.com, the mobile app, and phone support, enabling customers to troubleshoot issues, manage orders, and handle subscriptions independently. For human agents, the AI tools provide real-time conversation assessment, sentiment detection, and automated routine tasks like knowledge base navigation. The company has achieved significant cost reductions in content creation, with product Q&As now developed at a fraction of previous costs, while accelerating production cycles through process automation.
