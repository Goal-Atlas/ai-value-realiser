For customers, gen AI brings convenient self-service options like virtual assistants that give timely and spot-on answers to their queries. And for employees, gen AI tools can offer real-time tips and recommended solutions for addressing customer needs.\nBut here's the kicker: while gen AI is poised to be a game-changer for many companies\u201497% of organizations we surveyed believe it's going to be transformative\u2014only 31% have invested significantly in the technology.

The virtual assistant connects them to one of Best Buy\u2019s thousands of care agents who are also equipped with gen AI tools to solve customer queries and issues faster than ever before. The tools assess customer conversations in real-time and provide relevant recommendations and guidance. They can also detect sentiment and use data from calls to prevent similar issues in the future. Other tools automate routine tasks such as navigating knowledge bases, so agents can spend less time searching for info and more time understanding and empathizing with the customer.\nAt Best Buy we look at how gen AI can help enable our overall enterprise strategy while solving real human needs. We\u2019re implementing it in very strategic ways across our organization to personalize and humanize the consumer electronics shopping experience like no one else can.\nBrian Tilzer / Chief Digital, Analytics and Technology Officer, Best Buy\nBest Buy is all about making customers' lives better through technology.

The tools will also summarize conversations, detect sentiment, and use data from the call to lower the likelihood of similar issues recurring.\n\u201cAnd for our store employees across the country, we\u2019re working to develop a gen AI-powered assistant to provide easier access to things like company resources and product guides,\u201d Best Buy added in the release. \u201cThis will allow them to help customers more efficiently than ever.\u201d\nThe announcement came the same day that Google introduced a series of AI updates for its cloud customers focused on enterprise applications.\nAdvertisement: Scroll to Continue\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS spoke last week with Charles Nerko, an attorney in Barclay Damon\u2019s data security and technology practice area, about the ways businesses can protect themselves when introducing AI tools.\nTo guard against lawsuits, organizations that use AI should supervise the technology the same way they would supervise their human workforce, Nerko said. Contracts give AI providers the incentive to maintain high standards of accuracy and legality and set appropriate recourse when AI systems don\u2019t meet benchmarks.\nCraig Smith, a partner at the Boston law firm Lando and Anastasi who handles AI cases, added that companies using AI tools should carefully evaluate the systems to spot potential risks.\n\u201cTransparency will be key,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to understand how the AI models were trained and tested to ensure reliable results.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI and retail coverage, subscribe to the daily AI and Retail Newsletters."
