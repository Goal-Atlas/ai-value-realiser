# Case File: Arup Face Check Azure AI Security

## Executive Summary

This case file was created to investigate Arup's implementation of face check technology using Azure AI security features. However, the investigation is currently incomplete due to access restrictions on the primary source material. The Microsoft Cloud Blog post that was intended to provide information about AI-powered customer transformations returned a 403 Forbidden error, preventing content analysis.

**Key Issues:**
- Source material inaccessible (403 Forbidden error)
- No claims available for verification
- Investigation requires additional sources to proceed

**Status:** Investigation incomplete - requires alternative sources or access resolution.

## Detailed Findings

### Source Access Issues

The primary source identified for this case (Microsoft Cloud Blog post about AI-powered customer success stories) could not be accessed due to server restrictions. This has prevented the extraction of any specific claims about Arup's use of Azure AI for face check security implementations.

### Claims Analysis

No claims were available for analysis in this case file. This could be due to:
1. The inaccessible source material containing the relevant claims
2. The case being in an early stage of investigation
3. Claims requiring extraction from alternative sources

### Verification Status

Without accessible source material and defined claims, no verification or audit process could be completed for this case.

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**S1: AI-powered success—with more than 1,000 stories of customer transformation and innovation**
- **Type:** Blog Post
- **URL:** https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2025/07/24/ai-powered-success-with-1000-stories-of-customer-transformation-and-innovation/
