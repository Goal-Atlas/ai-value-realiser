- Measurable improvements in response time to new business opportunities

## Detailed Findings

### **APPROVED CLAIMS**

#### C2: Eliminated Manual Swivel-Chair Processes
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "The existing system also placed a heavy burden on Apex analysts, forcing them to live in a world of swivel-chair processes while manually performing much of the heavy lifting associated with their investigations."  
**Analysis:** Clear documentation of operational improvement through system modernization.

#### C4: Drag-and-Drop Functionality Implementation
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "Apex's analysts could easily drag and drop different components to meet their needs without having to rely on internal or third-party tech resources to overhaul the computer code."  
**Analysis:** Specific capability enhancement that reduces technical dependencies.

#### C7: 50% Faster Margin Calculations
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "AlloyDB fuels 50% faster margin calculations for Apex FinTech"  
**Analysis:** Quantified performance improvement with clear baseline comparison.

#### C8: Real-Time Margin Calculations
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "we needed real-time data from APIs to calculate the margin on demand and help our customers to determine their risk in seconds"  
**Analysis:** Clear capability transformation from batch to real-time processing.

#### C9: CPU Load and Cost Reduction
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "The columnar engine reduced the total CPU load on the database, saving costs by minimizing the required number of read replicas."  
**Analysis:** Specific technical optimization with measurable resource benefits.

### **CLAIMS REQUIRING REVIEW**

#### C1: False Positive Alert Reduction
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "With Apex's existing system, 80% of the alerts analysts received were false positives"  
**Gap:** While the 80% baseline is established, no specific post-implementation rate is documented. Requires additional evidence of actual reduction achieved.

#### C3: Faster Response to Business Opportunities
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "At Apex, we pride ourselves on being able to move quickly, So, we need a system or platform that can keep up with us. The financial crime system we had was like a huge cruise ship, and we needed a speedboat."  
**Gap:** Quote establishes need and intent but doesn't demonstrate measurable achievement of faster response times.

### **REJECTED CLAIMS**

#### C5 & C6: Duplicate Claims
**Status:** ❌ REJECTED  
**Reason:** Identical to C1 and C2 respectively. Redundant documentation.
