# Scuderia Ferrari AI-Driven Platform Case File

## Executive Summary

Scuderia Ferrari has successfully implemented a comprehensive AI-driven digital transformation strategy in partnership with IBM and AWS to revolutionize fan engagement and operational efficiency. The initiative centers around a reimagined mobile app powered by IBM's Watsonx platform that serves 396 million fans worldwide with personalized, interactive content generated from real-time Formula 1 race data.

Key achievements include tripling their fan base over three years, delivering post-race content within hours of race completion, and creating an immersive digital experience that transforms complex telemetry data into compelling narratives. The platform leverages generative AI to provide race recaps, interactive polls, fan messaging capabilities, and dynamic visualizations of driver and car performance data.

Beyond fan engagement, Ferrari has achieved significant operational improvements through AWS cloud infrastructure, including a 30 percentage point reduction in total cost of ownership, 60% faster product lifecycle simulations, and 20% improvement in car configurator efficiency with increased sales leads.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Fan Base Growth - APPROVED ✅
**Claim**: Ferrari's fan base has tripled in the last 3 years

**Evidence**: Direct quote from Team Principal Frédéric Vasseur confirms this dramatic growth: "This fan base has been growing at a rapid clip, it has tripled in the last 3 years alone and its composition has also evolved."

**Assessment**: This represents exceptional growth in the highly competitive Formula 1 entertainment market, indicating successful digital engagement strategies and broader sport popularity.

### C2: Global Fan Reach - APPROVED ✅
**Claim**: The platform serves 396 million fans worldwide

**Evidence**: IBM case study explicitly states the platform provides "a personalized and interactive mobile app experience for Scuderia Ferrari HP's 396 million fans around the world around the clock, 365 days a year."

**Assessment**: This massive global reach demonstrates the scale of Ferrari's digital transformation and the technical infrastructure required to serve such a large audience with personalized content.

### C3: Content Delivery Speed - APPROVED ✅
**Claim**: Post-race recaps are now available within hours of race finish

**Evidence**: Source confirms: "These post-race recaps of the Scuderia Ferrari HP team's performance are now available for fans within hours of a race finish."

**Assessment**: This rapid content turnaround represents a significant improvement in fan engagement timing, leveraging AI to process complex race data into consumable content quickly.

### C4: Infrastructure Cost Reduction - NEEDS REVIEW ⚠️
**Claim**: Infrastructure total cost of ownership reduced from 70% to 40%

**Evidence**: Quote states: "We've reduced the total cost of ownership for our infrastructure from 70 percent to 40 percent"

**Assessment**: The claim interpretation requires clarification. The quote suggests a 30 percentage point reduction in TCO (from 70% to 40%), but the context of what these percentages represent (of total IT budget, operational costs, etc.) needs verification for complete accuracy.

### C5: Simulation Performance - APPROVED ✅
**Claim**: Product lifecycle management simulations run 60% faster

**Evidence**: AWS case study confirms: "For example, the company can run simulations in its product lifecycle management software 60 percent faster than before."

**Assessment**: This performance improvement directly impacts Ferrari's ability to iterate on vehicle designs and test scenarios more rapidly, providing competitive advantages in both road car development and racing.

### C6: Car Configurator Efficiency - APPROVED ✅
**Claim**: Car configurator increased sales leads and reduced configuration times by 20%

**Evidence**: Source states: "Since rolling out the car configurator, Ferrari has increased its sales leads and reduced configuration times by 20 percent by offering a more personalized experience"

**Assessment**: This dual improvement in both sales effectiveness and operational efficiency demonstrates the business value of AI-powered personalization in luxury automotive sales.
