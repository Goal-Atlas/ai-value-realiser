# ServiceNow AI-Powered Headcount Savings Case File

## Executive Summary

ServiceNow has announced plans to achieve $100 million in headcount savings during 2025 through internal implementation of AI technologies. This initiative represents a significant workforce optimization strategy that the company claims will deliver substantial productivity gains while maintaining growth investments in sales and engineering roles. The company's strong financial performance, with Q2 2025 revenues of $3.2 billion (22.5% YoY growth) and Q3 2025 revenues of $3.4 billion (20.5% YoY growth), provides context for this AI-driven efficiency program.
