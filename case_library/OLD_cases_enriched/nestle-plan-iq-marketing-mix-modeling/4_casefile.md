# Case File: Nestlé's AI-Powered Supply Chain and Marketing Optimization

## Executive Summary

Nestlé, one of the world's largest food and beverage companies operating in over 190 countries, has strategically implemented AI across multiple operational touchpoints to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The company has deployed machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to transform its supply chain management, focusing on demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and logistics coordination.

The implementation has yielded measurable improvements in operational efficiency, with AI-powered forecasting systems reducing prediction errors by 30%. This enhanced accuracy has enabled better inventory management, reduced waste, and improved supply chain resilience through real-time monitoring and adaptive planning capabilities.
