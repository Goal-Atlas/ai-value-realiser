      "content": "Spotify\u2019s DJ Now Takes Requests, Enhancing Real-Time Music Discovery\nPeople all over the world love DJ. At the gym, at home, whenever and wherever you want a deeper experience with great music, DJ is the answer. In fact, DJ listener engagement has nearly doubled over the past year\u2014it\u2019s like having a personal musical friend who just gets you.\nWe also know that listeners have asked for more ways to interact with DJ and enjoy more control over their listening sessions. That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to share that DJ is now taking music requests, giving Premium users in more than 60 markets an entirely new way to curate the vibe of their listening sessions in real time. Serving up suggestions using AI and insights from our global editorial experts, DJ helps you uncover new tracks, rediscover old favorites, and connect deeply with the music you love.\nBy simply using your voice, you can now ask DJ to update your personalized listening session based on the music you want to hear at that moment, whether you\u2019re looking for something to set the mood for date night or need some high-energy tracks to get you hyped for a party.\nDJ can handle a combination of genre, mood, artist, or activity-related requests. For example, you could try, \u201cSurprise me with some indie tracks I\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d or \u201cGive me some electronic beats for a midday run.\u201d You could even request something like, \u201cPlay me some cry-in-the-car songs.\u201d\nListeners have come to know and love the personality and voice of our AI English-speaking DJ, modeled after Spotify\u2019s Xavier \u201cX\u201d Jernigan. Now you can actually talk to DJ X and ask for music to match any mood or moment. It\u2019s a two-way street, taking personalization to a whole new level.\nStart requesting music with DJ\nDJ requests will be available in English for Premium listeners in more than 60 markets where DJ is currently available. Here\u2019s how to make a request:\n-\n- Head to the search tab on Spotify and search \u201cDJ.\u201d\n- Press play and DJ will serve up a curated mix of music and commentary tailored to you.\n- Whenever you want to change up the vibe, press and hold the DJ button in the right-hand corner. You\u2019ll hear a beep when DJ is ready.\n- Use your voice to ask for the kind of music you want to hear at that moment.\n- Just like that, DJ will update your session based on your request, listening history, music preferences, and more.\n- Want to mix things up? Hold the DJ button to switch up the vibe or make a new request.\n- If you want to change the vibe but don\u2019t have a specific request, you can skip to the next section with a quick tap of the DJ button.\nWe should note that while requests with DJ are designed to be fun, the feature is still in beta and won\u2019t produce results for non-music-related requests, like audiobooks or podcasts.\nWe\u2019re excited to give our listeners even more control and to continue evolving the DJ experience. So get creative, make some requests, and let DJ take you on a personalized musical journey.\n*Update as of September 23, 2025: DJ now takes requests on Android Auto. Premium users can interact with DJ by simply tapping the \u201cTalk to DJ\u201d button on their car\u2019s Android Auto screen. Whether you\u2019re commuting to work or on a weekend getaway, effortlessly steer your DJ session on the road with voice requests like, \u201cPlay some new indie tracks.\u201d This new integration lets drivers seamlessly change the vibe wherever the road takes them.\nIn order to access the \u201cTalk to DJ\u201d button in your car, make sure you\u2019ve first given DJ microphone access on your phone."

      "content": "Spotify has bigger plans for the technology behind its new AI DJ feature after seeing positive consumer reaction to the new feature. Launched just ahead of the company\u2019s Stream On event in L.A. last week, the AI DJ curates a personalized selection of music combined with spoken commentary delivered in a realistic-sounding, AI-generated voice. But under the hood, the feature leverages the latest in AI technologies and large language models, as well as generative voice \u2014 all of which are layered on top of Spotify\u2019s existing investments in personalization and machine learning.\nThese new tools don\u2019t necessarily have to be limited to a single feature, Spotify believes, which is why it\u2019s now experimenting with other applications of the technology.\nThough the highlight from Spotify\u2019s Stream On event was the mobile app\u2019s revamp, which now focuses on TikTok-like discovery feeds for music, podcasts, and audiobooks, the AI DJ is now a prominent part of the streaming service\u2019s new experience. Introduced in late February to Spotify\u2019s Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, the DJ is designed to get to know users so well that it could play whatever you want to hear with a press of a button.\nWith the app\u2019s revamp, the DJ will appear at the top of the screen under the Music subfeed for subscribers, serving both as a lean-back way to stream favorite music and as a means to push free users to upgrade.\nTo create the commentary that accompanies the music the DJ streams, Spotify says it leveraged its own in-house music experts\u2019 knowledge base and insights. Using OpenAI\u2019s Generative AI technology, the DJ is then able to scale their commentary to the app\u2019s end users. And unlike ChatGPT, which is trying to create answers by distilling information found on the wider web, Spotify\u2019s more limited database of musical knowledge ensures the DJ\u2019s commentary ends up being both relevant and accurate.\nThe actual music selections chosen by the DJ come from its existing understanding of a user\u2019s tastes and interests, mirroring what would have before been programmed into personalized playlists, like Discover Weekly and others.\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector.\nThe AI DJ\u2019s voice, meanwhile, was created using technology Spotify acquired from Sonatic last year and is based on that of Spotify\u2019s head of Cultural Partnerships Xavier \u201cX\u201d Jernigan, host of Spotify\u2019s now-defunct morning show podcast, \u201cThe Get Up.\u201d Surprisingly, the voice sounds incredibly realistic and not at all robotic. (During Spotify\u2019s live event, Jernigan spoke alongside his AI double and the differences were difficult to spot. \u201cI can listen to my voice all day,\u201d he joked).\n\u201cThe reason it sounds this good \u2014 that is actually the aim of the Sonatic technology, the team which we acquired. It is about the emotion in the voice,\u201d explains Spotify\u2019s head of Personalization, Ziad Sultan, in a conversation with TechCrunch after Stream On wrapped. \u201cWhen you hear the AI DJ, you will hear where the pause is for breathing. You will hear the different intonations. You can hear excitement for certain types of genres,\u201d he says.\nA natural-sounding AI voice isn\u2019t new, of course \u2014 Google wowed the world with its own human-sounding AI creation years ago. But its implementation within Duplex led to criticism, as the AI dialed businesses on behalf of the end user, initially without disclosing it wasn\u2019t a real person. There should be no such similar concern with Spotify\u2019s feature, given it\u2019s even called an \u201cAI DJ.\u201d\nTo make Spotify\u2019s AI voice sound natural, Jernigan went into the studio to produce high-quality voice recordings, while working with experts in voice technology. There, he was instructed to read various lines using different emotions, which are then fed into the AI model. Spotify wouldn\u2019t say how long this process takes, or detail the specifics, noting that the technology is evolving and referring to it as its \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\u201cFrom that high-quality input that has a lot of different permutations, [Jernigan] then doesn\u2019t need to say anything anymore \u2014 now it is purely AI-generated,\u201d says Sultan of the generated voice. Still, Jernigan will sometimes p"

      "content": "How Does Spotify Use AI : Case Study\nFrom startups to giants, everyone\u2019s building with AI \u2014 and hiring AI PMs to do it.\nImagine this: It's Monday morning. You're commuting to work, earbuds in, when you open Spotify and see a fresh Discover Weekly playlist waiting for you. Those 30 songs\u2014somehow perfectly matched to your taste\u2014make the start of your week just a bit more bearable.\nThat's not a coincidence. It's AI at work.\nSpotify has transformed from a simple music streaming service into an AI-powered personalization platform that feels almost magical in its ability to predict what you want to hear. Let's explore how this transformation happened and what product managers across industries can learn from it.\nHow Spotify's AI Has Changed Over Time\n1. Discover Weekly (2015): The Foundation\nWhat it is: Weekly personalized playlist using collaborative filtering, natural language processing, and audio analysis\nImpact: Drives 30% of total listening time\nWhy it matters: Created a weekly engagement hook that users actively look forward to.\n2. Day lists: Contextual Awareness\nWhat it is: Updates 3x daily with quirky, context-aware titles (e.g., \"Witchy Ethereal Tuesday\").\nImpact: Achieves 80% engagement among personalization-preferring users.\nWhy it matters: Combining AI with a human-like personality.\n3. AI DJ (2023): Voice-Enabled Curation\nTechnology: Combines generative AI with voice cloning (Sonantic).\nExperience: Creates real-time playlists with human-like commentary.\nImpact: Boosts user retention by 15%.\n4. AI Playlist (2024): User Control\nWhat it is: Text-to-music generation allowing natural language prompts.\nExample: \"Songs for rainy days\" creates a themed playlist.\nEngagement: 60% weekly reuse among beta users.\nBusiness Impact of Spotify's AI Strategy\nFor product managers, the most compelling aspect of Spotify's AI strategy is how directly it ties to business outcomes:\nRevenue Growth\nAI-targeted advertising: +17% YoY, reaching \u20b912,806 Cr\nPremium subscriptions: +12% YoY to 252M users (with AI cited as core driver)\nOverall revenue: \u20b91,40,400 crore in 2024 (+17.9% YoY)\nUser Engagement & Retention\nAI users spend 140 mins/day vs. 99 mins for non-AI users\nAI-recommended users have 40% higher retention\nAI DJ feature boosted user retention by 15%\nPremium Conversion\nPersonalized playlists contribute to 46% of premium conversions\nAI-supported podcast listeners are 2x more likely to go premium\nThese metrics tell a powerful story: AI features aren't just \"nice to have\" engagement tools\u2014they're primary drivers of Spotify's core business metrics.\nThe Technical Stack Powering Spotify's AI Strategy\nProduct managers looking to implement AI should understand the infrastructure investments required. Spotify's AI capabilities are built on:\nEcho Nest (Acquired 2014): Improved algorithmic recommendations, resulting in 10% churn reduction\nSonantic (2022): Voice cloning technology supporting 14+ languages, powering the conversational AI DJ feature\nGoogle Cloud AI: Processing 500 B+ daily events in real-time\nThis demonstrates that serious AI product development requires both building proprietary technology and leveraging best-in-class infrastructure partners.\nHow Spotify Uses AI to Improve the User Experience?\nAcquisition\nSpotify Wrapped: AI-powered listening summary turned viral marketing tool\nImpact: 80M shares in 2024, driving organic growth\nRetention\nPersonalization: Creates habit-forming daily engagement\nResult: 44% daily active users vs. 35% industry average\nMonetization\nPremium Conversion: AI features drive subscription growth\nAd Targeting: Improved relevance increases ad revenue\nAddressing the Challenges:\nDespite its success, Spotify's AI implementation faces important challenges that product managers must consider:\nArtist Payout Imbalance:- AI tends to boost major label exposure, potentially risking indie artist earnings. This highlights how AI systems can inadvertently reinforce existing power dynamics if not carefully designed.\nTransparency & Trust:- The lack of explainability in recommendations raises filter bubble concerns. Users increasingly want to understand why they're seeing what they're seeing.\nProduct managers implementing AI must proactively address these ethical considerations rather than treating them as afterthoughts.\nKey Lessons for Product Managers\nAI as Product, Not Just Infrastructure: Position AI capabilities as core user-facing features, not just backend optimizations.\nMeasure AI Impact Directly: Create specific KPIs for AI features tied to business outcomes.\nBuild Distinctive AI Experiences: Add human touches (like Spotify's quirky playlist names) to differentiate from purely algorithmic competitors.\nCreate AI-Driven Engagement Loops: Design features that bring users back repeatedly (like Discover Weekly's Monday release).\nConsider Full-Funnel Impact: AI can serve acquisition (viral sharing of Spotify Wrapped), retention (personalized playlists), and monetization (premium conversions) simultaneously.\nSpot"
