# Canon USA Invoice Processing Automation Case Study

## Executive Summary

Canon USA successfully transformed their invoice processing operations through intelligent automation, addressing significant challenges with manual processing of over 4,500 vendor invoices monthly. The implementation involved replacing an underperforming RPA solution (35-40% accuracy) with custom machine learning models integrated with UiPath Document Understanding and Oracle 11i SAP. The transformation was executed by Greenlight Consulting and resulted in substantial improvements in processing speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency.

A parallel case study from Canon Business Process Services demonstrates similar success with a cosmetics company client, reducing invoice processing time from 45 days to 2 days average, while eliminating manual data entry and human errors.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: High-Volume Manual Processing Challenge ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Canon processed over 4,500 vendor invoices monthly with manual processes causing errors and delays

**Evidence:** "Canon's finance team was drowning in paperwork with over 4,500 vendor invoices to process every month. Each one came with complex details, and because so much of the work was done by hand, errors and delays were common."

**Analysis:** This claim provides specific volume metrics and clearly describes the operational challenges faced by Canon's finance team before automation implementation.

### C2: Previous RPA Solution Performance Issues ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Previous RPA solution had very low accuracy rates of only 35-40%

**Evidence:** "Even though they already had an RPA workflow in place, it was rigid and unreliable, needing constant human oversight and delivering accuracy rates of only 35–40%."

**Analysis:** Specific accuracy metrics demonstrate the limitations of the existing automation solution, providing clear justification for the transformation initiative.

### C3: Machine Learning Improvement ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim:** New solution achieved much higher accuracy using custom machine learning models instead of rigid RegEx rules

**Evidence:** "Instead of relying on rigid RegEx rules, we built custom machine learning models that could handle the complexity of their data with much higher accuracy."

**Analysis:** While the quote confirms the technical approach change from RegEx to machine learning, it lacks specific accuracy metrics to quantify the improvement claimed.

### C4: Client Processing Volume and Delays ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Client processed 1,500 invoices manually per day with payment delays up to 45 days

**Evidence:** "It had 1,500 invoices to manually process each day. Meanwhile, the company's seven plants in the region—which purchase cosmetics ingredients and packing materials, as well as pay staff salaries—wanted to be reimbursed immediately. For a period of time, they weren't—payment took as long as 45 days."

**Analysis:** Provides specific daily processing volumes and payment delay metrics, clearly establishing the baseline performance issues.

### C5: New System Processing Speed ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** New digital system processes invoices in 30 seconds when data matches, with invoices available within 24 hours

**Evidence:** "If an invoice is scanned and all the data fields match with the company's database, the process takes about 30 seconds and the invoice is available to the cosmetics company within 24 hours."

**Analysis:** Specific processing time metrics demonstrate the dramatic improvement in operational efficiency.

### C6: Payment Processing Time Improvement ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Payment processing time reduced from 45 days to an average of 2 days

**Evidence:** "Instead of 45 days, the company completes payment in an average of two days."

**Analysis:** Clear before/after comparison showing a 95.6% reduction in payment processing time.

### C7: Operational Benefits ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** New system eliminated data entry, human error, and paper accumulation

**Evidence:** "Job complete—without any data entry, human error, or paper piling up on the client's end."

**Analysis:** Specific operational improvements directly supported by the implementation results.
