      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- WPP unveiled WPP Open Pro, a new offering that allows brands to independently use its artificial intelligence-powered operating system, according to a press release.\n- The ad-holding group claims to be the first in its category to provide this type of model. Open Pro has three core service areas: AI-powered campaign planning, content creation at scale and campaign publishing, which brands can either handle directly or hand off to WPP's Open Media Studio.\n- Open Pro is positioned for performance-oriented marketers and smaller clients, such as startups or regional teams within a global brand, that may not have the resources to enlist a fully integrated agency. The launch follows WPP pledging to invest more in AI, a technology that is increasingly critical for agency success.\nDive Insight:\nOpen Pro represents a new type of bet for WPP and for agency networks at large \u2014 one that speaks to how AI is reshaping aspects of marketing services. Rather than hiring a specific agency, clients can now leverage WPP\u2019s AI-powered models for independent campaign planning and deployment. Open Pro is mostly angled at smaller businesses that cannot afford a full-service integrated agency and categories that prioritize speed and performance, such as e-commerce.\nThe Open Pro concept points to a potential depreciation in mid-level marketing services, with more client demand either flowing to plug-and-play automated tools or bespoke models for deep-pocketed brands. It\u2019s at once a risky bet \u2014 a lot can still go wrong with AI \u2014 and a display of confidence from WPP that its technology is ready for prime time.\nWPP CEO Cindy Rose in a press statement emphasized that the ad-holding group\u2019s \u201ctalented teams will always be at the heart of what we do, providing world-class strategic and creative partnership to the world\u2019s most complex brands\u201d through WPP Open.\n\u201cNow, we\u2019re adding WPP Open Pro to our offer, a powerful new edition that puts our AI advantage directly into the hands of a much wider array of brands and businesses,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThis is about transforming how marketing is delivered, expanding our total addressable market, and giving more brands the tools they need to lead in the AI era.\u201d\nOpen Pro covers three stages of getting a campaign off the ground. Users can tap into the solution for planning and strategy, relying on AI agents that share WPP\u2019s proprietary, partner and industry data. Following that, Open Pro offers AI-generated content creation, quickly spinning up brand-appropriate and channel-specific ads. Finally, Open Pro aids with media execution, with users able to either publish their work directly on ad platforms or use WPP\u2019s Open Media Studio for those purposes.\nFor WPP, Open Pro is designed to boost revenue by forging a line into new client bases. The company, which will share a Q3 trading update on Oct. 30, is trying to bounce back from a punishing period of declines and account losses. Rose, whose background is in tech, joined as CEO in September and has reaffirmed a commitment to AI as part of the turnaround. WPP last week pledged another $400 million to Google\u2019s AI tech as part of a five-year partnership extension.\nWith Open Pro, WPP is not only competing with other agencies that are winning new business through AI, but also digital ad platforms that have raced to stand up internal generative AI tools courting small- and mid-sized marketers. For example, Amazon in September rolled out an AI \u201ccreative partner\u201d that assists with similar tasks as Open Pro: product and audience research, storyboarding and content creation. On the agency front, WPP is also facing down the creation of a new behemoth as rivals Omnicom and Interpublic Group are on track to combine late next month."

      "content": "- Acquisition marks major strategic step forward for WPP\u00e2s AI-driven data offer, transforming the breadth and scale of data intelligence for WPP clients and leapfrogging traditional identity-based solutions\n\u00c2 - Allows WPP\u00e2s clients to maximize the value of their first-party data with privacy-enhancing connections to data providers and media partners, powering campaigns across the entire marketing ecosystem\n- Embeds an AI-enabled, safe, and secure infrastructure within WPP Open for data-driven marketing and AI model training for WPP and its clients\nApril 3, 2025. London, New York. WPP today announced the acquisition of InfoSum, the world\u00e2s leading data collaboration platform. InfoSum will join GroupM, WPP\u00e2s media investment group, to power the creation of a new generation of AI-enhanced marketing solutions for clients, delivered through the industry\u00e2s most powerful and secure data infrastructure.\nThe acquisition is a major strategic step forward for WPP\u00e2s AI-driven data offer, giving WPP and its clients immediate access to the industry\u00e2s largest cross-platform source of privacy-safe, actionable data for marketing intelligence, audience targeting, and AI model training.\nInfoSum\u00e2s patented cross-cloud data collaboration technology radically transforms the way companies generate audience intelligence by making it possible to connect data sources across the marketing ecosystem without moving or exposing data. By integrating InfoSum\u00e2s capabilities with WPP Open - WPP\u00e2s intelligent marketing operating system \u00e2 WPP clients can safely unlock the full potential of their customer data, enriched through advanced AI.\u00c2\nNow, using federated learning techniques, WPP clients will be able to generate new marketing intelligence based on their first-party data and the universe of data signals available to them through the InfoSum network, WPP\u00e2s data assets, and GroupM\u00e2s media intelligence. Clients can rapidly build, train, and deploy custom AI models that utilize these diverse datasets, generating insights and audiences instantly, optimizing campaigns across the entire marketing ecosystem, and delivering measurable improvements in campaign performance within hours rather than weeks.\nInfoSum\u00e2s extensive global data network represents hundreds of billions of data signals across multiple dimensions of data from media platforms including Channel 4, DIRECTV, ITV, Netflix, News Corp, and Samsung Ads, as well as major retailers around the world and identity and data partners like Experian, TransUnion, Circana, Dynata, and NCSolutions.\u00c2 \u00c2\nThe acquisition accelerates WPP\u00e2s creation of \u00e2Intelligence Beyond Identity\u00e2 for clients, enabling marketers to use 100% of their business intelligence and leapfrog traditional identity-based solutions that depend on decades-old, deteriorating databases weakened by cookie deprecation, platform fragmentation, and splintering audience match rates.\nMark Read, CEO of WPP, said:\n\"At WPP, we have been building the technology and data infrastructure that will give our clients a unique competitive advantage in the AI era. Bringing InfoSum into WPP is a major step forward for our data capabilities and the results we can deliver for our clients. It allows clients to stay in complete control of their first-party data, while also giving them access to vastly greater quantities of high-quality, privacy-compliant data and pioneering technology that is not available anywhere else in the market today.\u00e2\n\u00c2 Brian Lesser, CEO of GroupM, commented:\n\u00e2Directly integrating InfoSum\u00e2s global data network and technology infrastructure will allow our clients to create even more value from their first-party data and enable us to train client AI models against the most data, from the most places, at unprecedented scale and speed. Our approach recognizes the importance of identity data to today\u00e2s marketing strategies while allowing us to take advantage of the limitless opportunities for growth we can create by moving beyond them. As more and more clients leverage our AI-first solutions, every client model, every audience, and every campaign will benefit from network effects that will exponentially increase their intelligence and competitive advantage.\u00e2\u00c2\nLauren Wetzel, CEO of InfoSum, added:\n\u00e2InfoSum\u00e2s mission has always been to reimagine how data powers marketing in a secure, privacy-first, and, most importantly, impactful way for advertisers and consumers. WPP and GroupM are the perfect partners to help us accelerate our impact on a truly global scale. We couldn\u00e2t be more excited to join forces with the team at GroupM as privacy and security become non-negotiables, and AI allows us to redefine what\u00e2s possible for advertisers and our network of media and data partners.\u00e2\nInfoSum\u00e2s technology enables WPP clients to swiftly deploy secure data environments optimized for federated learning, allowing marketers to rapidly scale their custom AI models and onboard their data faster and more easily than ever before.

      "content": "We catch up with Google Cloud CMO Alison Wagonfeld and WPP\u2019s chief technology officer Stephan Pretorius to learn more about how Big Tech is doubling down on AI, even as investor confidence wavers.\nGoogle Cloud CMO Alison Wagonfeld\u2019s visit to WPP in London last week seemed particularly timely. She was in town as part of a wider European tour, as her partner company Alphabet, together with Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, doubled down on their AI investment strategy by announcing a combined $320bn on AI infrastructure this year, which is up from around $220bn last year.\nThe boost comes despite growing scrutiny over whether these massive outlays will yield a return fast enough to satisfy shareholders. Recent weaker-than-expected earnings from cloud divisions at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet have fuelled speculation that AI adoption isn\u2019t happening as fast as anticipated.\nMeanwhile, the arrival of DeepSeek, a lower-cost AI model from China, has raised new questions about whether proprietary AI platforms from US tech giants will retain their pricing power in the long run.\nAdvertisement\nWagonfeld was keen for The Drum to take a close look at how WPP is using AI and capitalizing on a partnership with Google, which was first announced at its Cloud Next conference last April. She sees the developing WPP Open AI system as a great use case as to why the investment is justified.\nSeated in a conference room at WPP\u2019s headquarters in London\u2019s Sea Containers House, with views of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral looming in the background, Wagonfeld directly addressed the market concerns surrounding AI\u2019s commercial viability.\nLast year, she points out, \u201cGoogle Cloud grew 30% \u2013 that\u2019s over $40bn. So, I think a 30% growth rate is showing that there is a lot of interest. We have thousands of companies that we\u2019re working with and different use cases \u2013 everything from our workspace customers who are using Gemini in Workspace, all the way to the largest enterprises that are using Google Cloud. So, we see a tremendous amount of growth and opportunity.\n\u201cGoogle isn\u2019t slowing down. We have thousands of companies actively using our AI tools and 90% of AI unicorns globally use Google Cloud.\u201d\nShe dismisses the idea that emerging AI models such as DeepSeek would derail investment. \u201cWe expect that there will be innovation within Google and within other companies. I think that\u2019s going to make everybody more excited to know what\u2019s possible.\u201d\nStephan Pretorius, WPP\u2019s chief technology officer who is setting up WPP Open, believes the premise of the DeepSeek debate is flawed. \u201cI think I\u2019m sort of keen that the debate moves away from model one-upmanship and into application and use of value. Because I can\u2019t think of another era where the general population has been so fascinated by really arcane technical details that they don\u2019t understand. The far more interesting discussion is, what are people using it for? How is it changing work?\u201d\nThere is no doubt that WPP has, so to speak, moved into an era of asking what time it is rather than debating how the clock works. While some companies are still in proof-of-concept mode with AI, WPP has gone all in. Over the past year, it has invested more than $300m in its AI-powered marketing platform, WPP Open, making it the foundation of its entire business model.\nThe scale of the transformation is striking. More than 3,500 people are working on the development of WPP Open and the platform is updated 30 times a day \u2013 a pace that is more like a tech company than a traditional agency. The number of active monthly users has reached 27,000.\nWhat has been created is a largely proprietary AI-powered marketing platform designed to unify WPP\u2019s entire business, integrating creative, media and production into a single system. While Google Cloud is a key partner, the platform is not tied to any single provider \u2013 it incorporates AI and cloud solutions from Nvidia, OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM WatsonX and Adobe Firefly, among others. This allows WPP Open to continuously evolve, ensuring access to the best AI models and infrastructure while embedding proprietary tools such as AI Performance Brain and Brand Brain to drive efficiency, creativity and brand consistency at scale.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a project,\u201d says Pretorius. \u201cWPP Open is the operating system of our business.\u201d\nThe biggest change isn\u2019t just the adoption of AI tools \u2013 it\u2019s how AI is breaking down traditional silos between creative, media and strategy. \u201cThe way that we\u2019ve always worked in marketing has been based on different functions \u2013 creative, media and strategy,\u201d explains Pretorius. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is those functions are blurring.\u201d\nAI is no longer just automating existing tasks \u2013 it\u2019s restructuring how the agency operates. \u201cCreative teams can now use AI to test ideas in real-time, planners can upload massive amounts of research and have AI summarize key insights, while media teams can generate and optimize campaigns instantly,\u201d says Pretorius.\nWPP Open also enables companies to e"
