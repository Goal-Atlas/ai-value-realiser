# Case File: Scottish Government IBM Solutions - Better Services Value

## Executive Summary

Social Security Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, partnered with IBM Consulting and Nordcloud to implement a comprehensive FinOps transformation addressing rapidly growing cloud costs. The initiative achieved remarkable results, delivering three years' worth of cost optimization goals in just 18 months, with a 30.4% reduction in cloud costs within the first year. The transformation established Social Security Scotland as a leader in FinOps capability within the UK public sector while maintaining service delivery standards for 1.8 million Scottish citizens across 17 benefits programs.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Accelerated cost optimization timeline by 50% (18 months vs. 3-year target)
- 30.4% cloud cost reduction in first year
- 78% of savings achieved through usage optimization
- Enhanced operational resilience and service delivery
- Established model for public sector cloud governance

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Accelerated Cost Optimization Timeline ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Achieved 3-year cost optimization goals in just 18 months

**Assessment:** This claim is well-supported with specific timeline metrics. The transformation delivered measurable cost optimization results in 18 months against an original 3-year target, representing a 50% acceleration in achieving financial objectives.

**Supporting Evidence:** Direct quote confirms "In just 18 months, Social Security Scotland achieved the cost optimization goals originally set for a three-year period."

### C2: First-Year Cost Reduction ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** 30.4% reduction in cloud costs within first year

**Assessment:** Highly verifiable claim with precise percentage and clear timeframe. This represents significant cost savings for a public sector organization managing cloud infrastructure for critical social services.

**Supporting Evidence:** Exact figure provided: "Within the first year alone, the organization had a 30.4% reduction in cloud costs."

### C3: Savings Methodology Breakdown ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** 78% of savings driven by usage optimization

**Assessment:** Specific breakdown of how savings were achieved, indicating the majority came from optimizing actual usage rather than just negotiating better rates. This suggests sustainable, operational improvements.

**Supporting Evidence:** Clear attribution: "78% of those savings driven by usage optimization."

### C4: Service Enhancement Claims ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim:** Enhanced digital service delivery and operational resilience

**Assessment:** While the quote supports this claim, the terms "enhanced," "smarter," and "more transparent" are qualitative without specific metrics. The claim lacks measurable indicators of service improvement or resilience enhancement.

**Concerns:** Vague qualitative benefits without supporting metrics or specific examples of enhanced service delivery.

### C5: Industry Leadership Position ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim:** Became a model for delivering taxpayer value in UK public sector

**Assessment:** Subjective positioning claim that's difficult to verify objectively. While the source states this, there's no comparative data or external validation of this "forefront" position or "model" status.

**Concerns:** Self-reported leadership claims without independent verification or comparative benchmarking against other public sector organizations.

### C6: Payment Processing Performance ✅ APPROVED
**Claim:** Successfully processed £3 million in payments over 42 consecutive weeks

**Assessment:** Highly specific operational metrics demonstrating successful system performance. The data shows consistent service delivery with 1,641 payments processed and 11 system releases deployed.

**Supporting Evidence:** Precise figures: "processed 1,641 payments over 42 consecutive weeks (batches) to the value of £3 million and deployed 11 releases."

### C7: Public Sector Efficiency Impact ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim:** Digital transformation drives efficiencies across public sector

**Assessment:** Forward-looking claim about efficiency gains without specific metrics, timeline, or measurable outcomes. The statement is strategic intent rather than demonstrated results.

**Concerns:** Speculative claim about future benefits without supporting evidence of actual efficiency improvements achieved.
