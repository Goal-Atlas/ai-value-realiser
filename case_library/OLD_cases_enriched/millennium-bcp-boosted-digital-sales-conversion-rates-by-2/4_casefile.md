# Millennium bcp: Digital Sales Conversion Rate Optimization

## Executive Summary

Millennium bcp, Portugal's largest private bank, successfully transformed their digital marketing approach by leveraging Google Cloud's BigQuery and AI capabilities to dramatically improve personal loan sales conversion rates. The bank implemented predictive modeling using behavioral patterns from existing clients to create highly targeted audience segments, resulting in significant improvements across both owned and paid media campaigns.

**Key Results:**
- 2.6x higher conversion rates in owned media campaigns
- 2.4x greater conversion volume for BigQuery-powered audiences
- Doubled conversion volume in paid media with 1.9x higher conversion rates
- 36% reduction in cost per acquisition (CPA)

The initiative was executed entirely in-house by Millennium bcp's digital marketing team, demonstrating the bank's commitment to data-driven customer experiences while maintaining privacy compliance through first-party data usage.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: BigQuery-powered audiences achieved 2.6x higher conversion rates in owned media
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

Millennium bcp's implementation of BigQuery-powered audience segmentation delivered substantial improvements in owned media performance. The bank used machine learning tools to analyze behavioral patterns of existing clients who had previously acquired personal loans, creating predictive models that identified prospects with varying levels of interest (low, medium, high).

**Evidence:** Direct quote from Google Cloud case study confirms "BigQuery-powered audiences delivered a 2.6x higher conversion rate compared to other first-party audiences in owned media."

### C2: BigQuery-powered audiences generated 2.4x greater conversion volume
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

Beyond improving conversion rates, the BigQuery-powered approach also significantly increased the absolute volume of conversions, indicating both better targeting accuracy and broader reach effectiveness.

**Evidence:** Source documentation states "Conversion volume for BigQuery-powered audiences was 2.4x greater than conversions from other first-party audiences."

### C3: Paid media campaigns doubled conversion volume with 1.9x higher conversion rates
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

The success extended beyond owned media to paid advertising campaigns, where the bank integrated their predictive models with Display & Video 360 for highly targeted campaigns. This approach delivered improvements in both conversion volume and efficiency.

**Evidence:** Case study confirms "Paid media campaigns' conversion volume doubled and conversion rates were 1.9x higher with BigQuery powered audiences."

### C4: Cost per acquisition dropped by 36% using BigQuery-powered audiences
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

The enhanced targeting capabilities not only improved conversion performance but also delivered significant cost efficiencies, reducing the cost per acquisition by more than one-third compared to traditional first-party audience approaches.

**Evidence:** Documentation states "Cost per acquisition (CPA) dropped by 36% when using BigQuery-powered audiences compared to regular first-party audiences."

### C5: Application deployment time improved from 8 days to 8 minutes
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

While Millennium bcp has implemented Radius for application deployment optimization, the specific metrics claimed (8 days to 8 minutes) are not directly supported by the available documentation. The source mentions a general goal of improving "from days of work to just minutes" but doesn't provide the exact timeframe improvements stated in the claim.

**Evidence Gap:** Source only states "Our goal was to improve from days of work to just minutes when deploying an application across all environments" without confirming the specific 8 days to 8 minutes improvement.
