# Nokia Network as Code Platform with Google Cloud AI Integration

## Executive Summary

Nokia has partnered with Google Cloud to enhance its Network as Code platform with AI capabilities, specifically leveraging Vertex AI and Gemini 1.5 Pro to accelerate 5G application development. This collaboration aims to provide developers worldwide with AI-enhanced tools for creating network-aware applications faster, starting with healthcare use cases. The platform enables developers to access standardized 5G network capabilities through APIs while improving productivity through AI-powered coding assistance.

The Network as Code platform, launched in September 2023, creates a unified ecosystem connecting telco networks, system integrators, and software developers. It operates on a revenue-sharing model between developers, operators, and Nokia, with 13 network operators already signed as collaboration partners across Europe, North America, and South America.
