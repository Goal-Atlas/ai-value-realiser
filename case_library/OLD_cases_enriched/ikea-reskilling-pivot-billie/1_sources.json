We have twists and turns with AI, thousands of people in peril and the saviour which brings hope (and a bag load of cash).\nToday, we\u2019re unpacking how IKEA reskilled 8,500 employees displaced by AI and made $1.4 billion doing it.\nGet your tea or beverage of choice ready, \ud83c\udf75.\nWe've got lots to discuss!\n\u2192 Much love to today\u2019s sponsor, You Can Now \u2764\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udc40 In today\u2019s chat:\nHuman centered reskilling in the age of AI\nDon\u2019t be ashamed to use AI\nAI and automation aren\u2019t the same\nFYI, the AI For Business Bootcamp is now sold out! If you want to get early access to the next cohort, drop your name on the waitlist.\nTHE BIG THOUGHT\nA Tale of AI, Skills, Sexy Scandinavian Furniture And A Billion Dollars\nHere we go!\nAI is everything, everywhere and all at once.\nEvery industry is freaking out about what it will do to them. The challenge for many businesses isn\u2019t just how to adopt the technology, but what to do with the people it displaces.\nIKEA, a global leader in sleek furnishings (and delicious meatballs), faced this dilemma when they introduced an AI chatbot to handle customer service.\nBillie, the AI bot, effectively managed 47% of customer inquiries.\nThis created a problem. The AI was really good and cost less money than humans. You\u2019ve probably hear similar horror stories that start like this with other companies (looking at you Klarna).\nBut instead of cutting jobs, IKEA chose a different path, one that not only reskilled 8,500 employees but also generated a remarkable $1.4 billion in additional revenue.\nSee what I mean about movie potential? Just imagine the trailer.\nI digress!\nThis case study is about how strategic reskilling, alongside AI adoption, can drive both business success and employee growth.\nLet\u2019s crack open that popcorn \ud83c\udf7f\nAct 1: Displaced by AI\nLike many retailers, IKEA deals with a high volume of customer service queries.\nSide note: Customer service is a super hard job. One I would not survive, so if you do/have been there, I salute you \ud83e\udee1.\nTo meet this demand more efficiently, they introduced an AI chatbot capable of handling routine customer inquiries. This solution quickly became a cost-effective tool while significantly reducing the need for human intervention.\nPositive but also negative.\nThe decision to automate this posed a critical question: What would happen to the thousands of employees whose roles were now largely redundant?\nInstead of following the path of least resistance and letting these employees go, IKEA created a different story.\nThey realised that while the chatbot could handle basic queries, there were still numerous areas of the business where human skills and expertise were essential.\nWhy don\u2019t more company\u2019s think like this?\nAct 2: How IKEA turned 8,500 Call Center Reps into Interior Design Advisors\nCompiling this research required a crazy amount of internet sleuthing (thanks, Perplexity).\nI couldn\u2019t find out everything though. Particularly around how employees were reskilled into these new roles, and how long it took. Saying that, if you happen to work at IKEA and might know something, slide into my DMs.\nAnyway, back to the action.\nIKEA weren\u2019t going to turn their back on these people. Their answer to this challenge was a comprehensive reskilling initiative. They had a plan to scale their interior design service.\nBasically, you can call IKEA and they\u2019ll help you pick complementary items for your room or their latest piece of sleek Scandinavian furniture you just purchased.\nPretty smart.\nSo, rather than downsizing, the company retrained 8,500 employees for these new roles as interior design consultants. These roles would leverage their existing customer service skills but added new layers of expertise that aligned with the company\u2019s evolving business needs.\nThis is the point of the term \u201cReskilling\u201d.\nInstead of starting from scratch, they built on the employee\u2019s foundational customer service knowledge. We can assume in this, training programs focused on crafting specific customer interaction, design, and sales capabilities.\nOthers were most likely up-skilled to handle more complex customer service tasks that required empathy and creative problem-solving.\nThe skills we know that AI can\u2019t replicate.\nAct 3: Show me the money, or, how reskilling created a $1.4 billion profit\nJerry knows\nOK, we\u2019re near the end of our heroic tale.\nThe results of IKEA\u2019s reskilling efforts were the stuff of high-grossing Disney films.\nNot only did the company avoid layoffs, but they also unlocked new revenue streams. By retraining employees to offer value-added services in interior design consultations, IKEA enhanced their customer exp"

It did so by giving new skills to 8,500 employees displaced by the introduction of a AI assistant, and making a nice $1.4 billion in profit for its efforts.\nThe challenge: Displaced by AI\nLike many retailers, IKEA deals with a high volume of customer service queries.\nTo meet this demand more efficiently, they introduced an AI chatbot capable of handling routine customer inquiries. This AI solution quickly became a cost-effective tool, significantly reducing the need for human intervention.\nPositive but also negative.\nThe decision to automate, however, posed a critical question: what would happen to the thousands of employees whose roles were now largely redundant?\nInstead of following the path of least resistance and letting these employees go, IKEA created a different story. They realised that while the chatbot could handle basic queries, there were still numerous areas of the business where human skills and expertise were essential.\nOne of those in reviewing and improving the Chatbots answers, and others in new business areas.\nHow IKEA turned 8,500 Call Center Reps into Interior Design Advisors in under two years\nIKEA\u2019s answer to this challenge was a comprehensive reskilling initiative.\nRather than downsizing, the company retrained 8,500 employees for new roles in such as interior design consultants. Basically, an advisor helps you pick the items that would best compliment a room or previous orders.\nThese roles leveraged their existing customer service skills but added new layers of expertise that aligned with the company\u2019s evolving business needs.\nThis is the point of the term \u201cReskilling\u201d\nWhat made IKEA\u2019s approach particularly impactful was how they identified the gap between the employees\u2019 current skills and the demands of the new roles.\nInstead of starting from scratch, they built on the employees\u2019 foundational customer service knowledge. Training programs focused on crafting specific customer interaction, design, and sales capabilities.\nOthers were up-skilled to handle more complex customer service tasks that required empathy, creative problem-solving, and expertise. The skills we know that AI can\u2019t replicate.\nThe unexpected $1.4 Billion boost to IKEA sales\nThe results of IKEA\u2019s reskilling efforts were remarkable.\nNot only did the company avoid layoffs, but they also unlocked new revenue streams. By retraining employees to offer value-added services in interior design consultations, IKEA enhanced their customer experience and sales.\nThe financial impact was significant: the company reported an unexpected $1.4 billion in additional revenue.\nThis is a powerful reminder that technology and people don\u2019t have to be in competition. When deployed thoughtfully, AI can free up human talent to focus on more strategic and revenue-generating tasks.\n(Yes, read that line again over-eager CEO).\nWhy reskilling, not downsizing is the answer to AI adoption\nJobs being displaced by AI doesn\u2019t mean the end.\nIt\u2019s actually an opportunity craft new skills and deploy human resource where it is needed most in your business.\n- Reskilling is a Strategic Advantage, Not a Cost\nIkea\u2019s story demonstrates that reskilling isn\u2019t just about retaining employees, it\u2019s about positioning your business for growth.\nInstead of viewing AI as a threat to jobs, IKEA saw it as an opportunity to redeploy human talent to higher value roles. For L&D professionals, this is a key lesson: your reskilling efforts should be aligned with the strategic goals of the business.\nWhen done right, they can drive both employee engagement and financial performance. - AI and Human Skills Can Coexist\nOne of the biggest concerns surrounding AI adoption is the fear that it will replace human jobs.\nIKEA\u2019s approach shows that AI can complement human capabilities rather than replace them. While the chatbot took over routine customer service tasks, humans were freed up to take on more complex, creative, and customer-centric roles\u2014areas where AI still falls short.\nL&D teams should focus on identifying these complementary areas within their organisation\u2019s.

      "content": "AI is reshaping industries at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before. The real challenge for many businesses isn\u2019t just how to embrace this technology, but how to manage the human impact it brings.\nTake IKEA, for example. Known globally for its home furnishings\u2014and yes, its meatballs\u2014IKEA introduced an AI chatbot, Billie, to handle customer inquiries. Billie took on 47% of these interactions. Yet, instead of cutting jobs, IKEA chose a different route, retraining 8,500 employees and unlocking an impressive $1.4 billion in new revenue.\nThis case study is a prime example of how businesses can harness AI and pair it with strategic reskilling to drive growth for both the business and its people.\nThe Challenge: AI and Job Displacement\nLike many retailers, IKEA faced a high volume of customer service inquiries. The AI chatbot was an effective solution, reducing the need for human intervention. However, it raised a critical question: what happens to the employees whose roles are now redundant?\nIKEA\u2019s answer was forward-thinking. Rather than downsizing, the company saw potential in its workforce. While AI could handle routine tasks, human expertise was still essential in areas like improving the chatbot\u2019s responses and driving new business initiatives.\nReskilling 8,500 Employees: A Transformative Strategy\nIKEA took a bold step by reskilling 8,500 employees, transitioning them from call center roles to interior design consultants. These new roles capitalized on their customer service experience while adding new skills aligned with IKEA\u2019s evolving business needs.\nThe approach was strategic. IKEA didn\u2019t start from scratch. Instead, they identified the gap between current capabilities and the skills needed for the new roles, focusing on customer interaction, design, and sales. Other employees were retrained for more complex service tasks, ones that required empathy, creativity, and problem solving \u2013 areas where AI still lags.\nThe $1.4 Billion Boost\nThe results speak for themselves. By investing in reskilling, IKEA not only retained employees but also created new revenue streams. The $1.4 billion increase in sales is proof that AI and human talent can coexist\u2014and even thrive together.\nThis underscores an important lesson for businesses: technology doesn\u2019t have to replace people. When used wisely, AI can enable employees to focus on more valuable, strategic work that drives growth.\nThe Strategic Value of Reskilling\nIKEA\u2019s approach shows that reskilling isn\u2019t just about job retention; it\u2019s about future-proofing your business. AI should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat.\nThe takeaway is clear: reskilling should align with your organization\u2019s strategic goals, fostering both engagement and financial performance.\nAI and Human Skills: A Powerful Combination\nIKEA\u2019s experience proves that AI and human expertise can complement each other. While AI handles routine tasks, human talent is critical for complex and creative problem solving. Digital first businesses should focus on developing skills that enhance, rather than compete with, AI capabilities.\nReskilling Done Right\nIKEA didn\u2019t offer generic training; they designed targeted programs that addressed specific business needs. This highlights the importance of crafting reskilling programs that build on existing skills, closing the gap between current abilities and the demands of AI-driven roles.\nInvest in People, Reap the Rewards\nPerhaps the most powerful lesson from IKEA\u2019s journey is the value of investing in people. While AI offers cost savings, the long-term benefits of developing human talent far outweigh those savings. IKEA\u2019s reskilling initiative preserved jobs and turned potential disruption into a growth opportunity.\nAll too often businesses are keen to cut costs through sometimes dramatic headcount reduction.\nWe see this as a short-sighted view. Hiring great talent takes time and HR teams should be advocating for reskilling initiatives at the leadership level. When employees feel valued, empowered and are allowed to grow, the business benefits are clear.\nA Path Forward in the Age of AI\nIKEA\u2019s story offers a roadmap for businesses navigating the challenges of AI adoption. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, companies can leverage it as a tool for innovation while reskilling their workforce for new demands.\nThe $1.4 billion result is a testament to the power of investing in people\u2014proving that it\u2019s not just a moral decision but a strategic one."
