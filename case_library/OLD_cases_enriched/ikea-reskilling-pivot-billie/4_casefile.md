# Case File: IKEA's AI-Driven Workforce Transformation and Revenue Generation

## Executive Summary

IKEA faced a classic AI displacement challenge when their chatbot "Billie" began handling 47% of customer service inquiries, potentially making 8,500 call center employees redundant. Instead of pursuing layoffs, IKEA executed a strategic workforce transformation, reskilling these employees into interior design consultants and other value-added roles. This approach not only preserved jobs but fundamentally shifted the workforce from a cost center to a revenue generator.

The transformation yielded remarkable results, with IKEA reporting $1.4 billion in additional revenue from their reskilled workforce. By leveraging AI to handle routine inquiries while redirecting human talent toward higher-value customer consultation services, IKEA demonstrated how strategic workforce transformation can create new business value rather than simply reducing costs.
