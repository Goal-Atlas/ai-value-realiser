# Case File: Siemens Healthineers' AI-Rad Companion

## Executive Summary

Siemens Healthineers has developed AI-Rad Companion, an artificial intelligence-powered diagnostic assistant for radiology that analyzes CT scans and chest X-rays to identify organs, lesions, and potential abnormalities. The platform represents a significant advancement in medical imaging technology, designed to address the growing challenge of increasing patient volumes coupled with radiologist shortages.

Clinical validation studies demonstrate measurable improvements in diagnostic accuracy, with the AI system achieving superior sensitivity rates for detecting lung lesions (83% vs 52%), consolidations (88% vs 78%), and atelectasis (54% vs 43%) compared to traditional written reports. The system provides automated quantitative reporting and helps radiologists identify potentially disease-relevant changes that might otherwise be missed during routine examinations.

The AI-Rad Companion platform integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows through cloud-based infrastructure, supporting radiologists in making faster, more accurate diagnoses while reducing documentation time. The technology addresses critical healthcare challenges by augmenting human expertise rather than replacing it, enabling radiologists to handle higher case volumes while maintaining diagnostic quality.
