      "content": "Not for publication in the USA\n- AI-Rad Companion Chest CT is an AI-based software assistant for computed tomography.\n- It identifies and measures organs and lesions on CT images of the thorax, and automatically generates a quantitative report.\n- It can help increase productivity and quality in radiology.\nAt the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago, USA, Siemens Healthineers will be presenting its first intelligent software assistant for radiology, which can identify organs and potentially disease-relevant changes. AI-Rad Companion Chest CT* is a software assistant that brings artificial intelligence (AI) to computed tomography (CT). Teams of Siemens Healthineers scientists trained the underlying algorithms based on extensive clinical datasets. Using CT images of the thorax (chest), the software can differentiate between the various structures of the chest, highlight them individually, and mark and measure potential abnormalities. This applies equally to organs such as the heart and lungs, the aorta and the vertebral bodies. The software automatically turns the findings into a quantitative report.\nAI-Rad Companion Chest CT is the first application based on the new AI-Rad Companion platform. It is designed to help radiologists interpret images faster and more accurately, and to reduce the time involved in documenting results. Being at the forefront of digitalization and AI, Siemens Healthineers will provide further intelligent assistants on its AI-Rad Companion to support healthcare providers\u2019 transformation towards value-based healthcare.\n\u201cAI-Rad Companion Chest CT is a tool that can actually simultaneously increase productivity and quality in diagnostic radiology,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Hartung, Head of Computed Tomography at Siemens Healthineers. \u201cThe intelligent assistant also alerts physicians to potentially disease-relevant changes that would otherwise have been missed because they were not the focus of the original examination. This means that \u2013 while also considering the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, of course \u2013 physicians can make faster, more accurate, and more comprehensive diagnoses.\u201d\n\u201cFor 20 years now, Siemens Healthineers has been a pioneer in developing applications based on artificial intelligence. One of the goals we have for our intelligent digital companions is that they\u2019ll help healthcare providers overcome the challenge of rising patient numbers coupled with shortfalls in staff,\u201d says Yan Beynon, Head of Digital Services at Siemens Healthineers. \u201cArtificial intelligence won\u2019t replace radiologists. It will relieve them of routine tasks and can thereby increase the efficiency and quality of diagnostic imaging processes.\u201d\nIn many countries, the number of radiological examinations is constantly growing, but the number of experts is not keeping pace. As a result, it is not uncommon for radiologists to conduct as many as 100 examinations in a day. This means that they interpret a new clinical image every three to four seconds \u2013 for eight hours a day and more.1 CT examinations of the thorax are common procedures in daily clinical practice. For radiologists, this means more examinations in a limited amount of time and usually for low reimbursement rates.\nIn radiology, examinations of the chest, a region containing multiple organs, are also challenging because the images display a wide variety of information. Radiologists mainly assess images regarding the primary indication \u2013 in other words, the possible disease \u2013 which was the reason for performing the CT scan. By contrast, the algorithms in AI-Rad Companion Chest CT pay equal attention to all areas of the chest and can mark abnormalities in places that the radiologist might not consider so closely. The software assistant generates standardized, reproducible, and quantitative reports based on the AI-supported analysis.\nAI-Rad Companion Chest CT currently supports a variety of tasks, such as identifying lung lesions and calculating cardiovascular risk based on an analysis of coronary artery calcification on non-ECG-triggered CT images. A study in collaboration with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) has also shown that AI-Rad Companion Chest CT can segment and measure the diameter of the aorta, an important parameter for potential aneurysms. These study results will be presented at RSNA 2018.2 AI-Rad Companion Chest CT also examines the spine in the patient\u2019s chest region. It detects and segments the individual vertebrae, labels and analyses them for bone density and possible fractures. This can be helpful for detecting osteoporotic changes at an early stage.\nAI-Rad Companion Chest CT is a cloud-based solution and uses certified, secure teamplay** infrastructure that complies with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., and with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. The software integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows and confo"

      "content": "Abstract\nThe AI-Rad Companion Chest X-ray (AI-Rad, Siemens Healthineers) is an artificial-intelligence based application for the analysis of chest X-rays. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the AI-Rad. In total, 499 radiographs were retrospectively included. Radiographs were independently evaluated by radiologists and the AI-Rad. Findings indicated by the AI-Rad and findings described in the written report (WR) were compared to the findings of a ground truth reading (consensus decision of two radiologists after assessing additional radiographs and CT scans). The AI-Rad can offer superior sensitivity for the detection of lung lesions (0.83 versus 0.52), consolidations (0.88 versus 0.78) and atelectasis (0.54 versus 0.43) compared to the WR. However, the superior sensitivity is accompanied by higher false-detection-rates. The sensitivity of the AI-Rad for the detection of pleural effusions is lower compared to the WR (0.74 versus 0.88). The negative-predictive-values (NPV) of the AI-Rad for the detection of all pre-defined findings are on a high level and comparable to the WR. The seemingly advantageous high sensitivity of the AI-Rad is partially offset by the disadvantage of a high false-detection-rate. At the current stage of development, therefore, the high NPVs may be the greatest benefit of the AI-Rad giving radiologists the possibility to re-insure their own negative search for pathologies and thus boosting their confidence in their reports.\nSubject terms: Diseases, Health care, Medical research\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, the corona pandemic has once again shown that medical staff are exposed to an extremely high level of stress in their clinical routine1,2. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care has been discussed extensively for several years in order to support medical staff with the increasing workload in their daily routine\u2014especially in highly technical fields such as radiological departments that deal with image-based tasks3,4.\nAlthough various AI-based applications are principally conceivable in medicine, the evaluation of chest radiographs appears to be a good opportunity to establish an AI-based algorithm in clinical routine5. Eltorai et al. conducted an online survey in which they asked both radiologists and computer science experts about their expectations regarding the future impact of AI applications on the field of radiology. As part of this survey, they also asked radiologists about their desire for specific AI applications. About 30% of the radiologists declared an interest in AI applications that detect atelectasis (29.5%), pleural effusions (30.5%) and consolidations (31.6%). Even more radiologists expressed their interest in AI applications that indicate pneumothoraces (56.8%) and pulmonary nodules (88.4%)6.\nThe majority of studies evaluating the performance of AI-based algorithms for the interpretation of chest radiographs focus on one particular finding, e.g. signs of COVID-19 infection or tuberculosis7\u201314. The AI-based detection of lung nodules has also been aim of various studies in the past15\u201317.\nSiemens Healthineers (Erlangen, Germany) offers an AI-based application for the automated analysis of radiographs of the chest, which continuously aims to develop a holistic approach to patient care. Currently, the AI Rad Companion Chest X-ray (AI-Rad) is designed to detect five specific radiographic findings: pulmonary lesions, consolidation, atelectasis, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. The AI-Rad is considered a diagnostic aid to support radiologists in their clinical routine.\nHomayounieh et al. have tested the AI-Rad algorithm with regard to the detection of lung nodules15. Their study included 100 p.a. chest radiographs that were evaluated by nine radiologists with different levels of experience. Each radiologist reviewed all images in two sessions\u2014once in an unaided mode, once in AI-aided mode. In the AI-aided session, the mean sensitivity, specificity and detection accuracy for the detection of lung nodules among all radiologists improved by 10.4%, 2.4% and 6.4% compared to unaided session. Junior radiologists experienced greater improvements in sensitivity compared to senior radiologists, whereas all radiologists experienced similar improvements in specificity15.\nThe purpose of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the AI-Rad. We compared the performance metrics of the AI-Rad with those of clinical radiologists by analyzing the findings described in the written reports and the findings detected by the AI algorithm.\nMethods\nPatient population\nAll radiographs were performed for diagnostic reasons. In total, 499 consecutive patients, who were examined between August and September 2021, were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Patients were not preselected regarding any personal characteristics (e.g. weight, age, gender) or certain pathologies. The radiographs were acquired with seven different X-ray devices tha"

It saves the clinicians\u2019 time and helps them to increase their diagnostic precision. The steady rise of radiology examinations and staff shortages lead to a limited amount of time per case as well as an increasing danger of missing clinically relevant findings. Siemens Healthineers is continuously working on further solutions to expand and enhance its AI-Rad Companion algorithms. These algorithms are trained, tested and validated against a substantial amount of data sets. The data sets are selected to reflect the diversity of the population, avoid bias and deliver reliable results. \u201cMeanwhile I really trust the algorithm. It gives me a sense of additional security.\u201d, states Dr. med.
