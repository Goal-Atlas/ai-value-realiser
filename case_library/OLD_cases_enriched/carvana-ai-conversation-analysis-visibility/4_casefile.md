# Carvana AI Conversation Analysis and Visibility Case File

## Executive Summary

This case file was created to investigate Carvana's implementation of AI conversation analysis and visibility systems. However, the investigation encountered significant data collection challenges that prevented comprehensive analysis.

**Key Issues Identified:**
- All primary sources experienced access restrictions or technical failures
- Microsoft customer story returned 403 Forbidden error
- Google Think case study blocked by cookie consent requirements
- Business Wire press release timed out during content retrieval
- No verifiable claims could be extracted or audited

**Current Status:** Incomplete - requires alternative data sources and collection methods to proceed with meaningful analysis.

## Detailed Findings

### Data Collection Challenges

**Source Accessibility Issues:**
- **Microsoft Customer Story (S1):** Access denied with 403 error, suggesting either content restrictions or authentication requirements
- **Google Think Case Study (S2):** Content blocked by privacy/cookie consent wall, preventing automated content extraction
- **Business Wire Press Release (S3):** Connection timeout during retrieval, indicating potential server issues or rate limiting

### Missing Claims Analysis

No claims were provided for audit in this case file, which combined with the source access issues, results in no substantive findings about Carvana's AI conversation analysis capabilities.

### Recommendations for Investigation Continuation

1. **Alternative Source Identification:** Locate publicly accessible documentation about Carvana's AI implementations
2. **Direct Outreach:** Consider contacting Carvana directly for case study information
3. **Technical Resolution:** Address source access issues through proper authentication or alternative retrieval methods
4. **Claim Development:** Develop specific claims about Carvana's AI conversation analysis systems for future verification
