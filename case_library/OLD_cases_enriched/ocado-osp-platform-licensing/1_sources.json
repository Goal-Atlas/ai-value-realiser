      "content": "Challenge\nThe world's largest online-only grocery retailer, Ocado developed the Ocado Smart Platform to manage its own operations, from websites to warehouses, and is now licensing the technology to other retailers such as Kroger. To set up the first warehouses for the platform, Ocado shifted from virtual machines and Puppet infrastructure to Docker containers, using CoreOS's fleet scheduler to provision all the services on its OpenStack-based private cloud on bare metal. As the Smart Platform grew and \"fleet was going end-of-life,\" says Platform Engineer Mike Bryant, \"we started looking for a more complete platform, with all of these disparate infrastructure services being brought together in one unified API.\"\nSolution\nThe team decided to migrate from fleet to Kubernetes on Ocado's private cloud. The Kubernetes stack currently uses kubeadm for bootstrapping, CNI with Weave Net for networking, Prometheus Operator for monitoring, Fluentd for logging, and OpenTracing for distributed tracing. The first app on Kubernetes, a business-critical service in the warehouses, went into production in the summer of 2017, with a mass migration continuing into 2018. Hundreds of Ocado engineers working on the Smart Platform are now deploying on Kubernetes.\nImpact\nWith Kubernetes, \"the speed from idea to implementation to deployment is amazing,\" says Bryant. \"I've seen features go from development to production inside of a week now. In the old world, a new application deployment could easily take over a month.\" And because there are no longer restrictive deployment windows in the warehouses, the rate of deployments has gone from as few as two per week to dozens per week. Ocado has also achieved cost savings because Kubernetes gives the team the ability to have more fine-grained resource allocation. Says DevOps Team Leader Kevin McCormack: \"We have more confidence in the resource allocation/separation features of Kubernetes, so we have been able to migrate from around 10 fleet clusters to one Kubernetes cluster.\" The team also uses Prometheus and Grafana to visualize resource allocation, and makes the data available to developers. \"The increased visibility offered by Prometheus means developers are more aware of what they are using and how their use impacts others, especially since we now have one shared cluster,\" says McCormack. \"I'd estimate that we use about 15-25% less hardware resources to host the same applications in Kubernetes in our test environments.\"\nThe company began developing its Ocado Smart Platform to manage its own operations, from websites to warehouses, and is now licensing the technology to other grocery chains around the world, such as Kroger. To set up the first warehouses on the platform, Ocado shifted from virtual machines and Puppet infrastructure to Docker containers, using CoreOS's fleet scheduler to provision all the services on its OpenStack-based private cloud on bare metal. As the Smart Platform grew, and \"fleet was going end-of-life,\" says Platform Engineer Mike Bryant, \"we started looking for a more complete platform, with all of these disparate infrastructure services being brought together in one unified API.\"\nBryant had already been using Kubernetes with Code for Life, a children's education project that's part of Ocado's charity arm. \"We really liked it, so we started looking at it seriously for our production workloads,\" says Bryant. The team that managed fleet had researched orchestration solutions and landed on Kubernetes as well. \"We were looking for a platform with wide adoption, and that was where the momentum was,\" says DevOps Team Leader Kevin McCormack. The two paths converged, and \"We didn't even go through any proof-of-concept stage. The Code for Life work served that purpose,\" says Bryant.\nIn the summer of 2016, the team began migrating from fleet to Kubernetes on Ocado's private cloud. The Kubernetes stack currently uses kubeadm for bootstrapping, CNI with Weave Net for networking, Prometheus Operator for monitoring, Fluentd for logging, and OpenTracing for distributed tracing.\nThe first app on Kubernetes, a business-critical service in the warehouses, went into production a year later. Once that app was running smoothly, a mass migration continued into 2018. Hundreds of Ocado engineers working on the Smart Platform are now deploying on Kubernetes, and the platform is live in Ocado's warehouses, managing tens of thousands of orders a week. At full capacity, Ocado's latest warehouse in Erith, southeast London, will deliver more than 200,000 orders per week, making it the world's largest facility for online grocery.\nThere are about 150 microservices now running on Kubernetes, with multiple instances of many of them. \"We're not just deploying all these microservices at once. We're deploying them all for one warehouse, and then they're all being deployed again for the next warehouse, and again and again,\" says Bryant.\nThe move to Kubernetes was eye-opening for many people at Ocado"

      "content": "Gives product teams a single source of truth for consistent data insights with Looker\u2019s powerful semantic layer\n700 weekly active users generate their own insights with Looker\u2019s extensive self-serve functionality\nBuilds external reporting capability in just three months thanks to Looker\u2019s reusable metric definitions\nOcado Technology used Looker to generate fast, accurate, consistent reports to refine its online grocery products and improve the services for its partners.\nWhen Ocado launched in 2000 with a vision to revolutionize the online grocery space, people said it couldn\u2019t be done. The idea of packing large orders of perishable items from a product range of tens of thousands \u2014 and delivering them on time, every time \u2014 was impossible, they said. In a sense, they were right: There was no technology at the time that could manage such a task. So Ocado created its own technology, enabling it to take orders online, fulfill them centrally, and deliver punctually to customers\u2019 doors. As the company grew, so did the sophistication of its in-house technology, prompting the strategic decision to start selling it to other retailers too.\nToday, the company\u2019s R&D arm, Ocado Technology, has a 2,700-strong team of technologists developing artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation technology. Used by 13 retailers around the world, from Kroger in the USA to AEON in Japan, and with more than 1,200 granted patents, Ocado has become a global tech powerhouse.\nAt the heart of its offering is the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP), an end-to-end platform that enables everything from ecommerce to fulfillment, logistics to supply chains, as well as incorporating futuristic fleets of robots that can pick and pack 50-item orders in minutes.\nOSP generates vast amounts of data \u2014 just one of Ocado Technology\u2019s warehouses generates 75 TB of semi-structured data per day \u2014 which is all stored in Google Cloud\u2019s enterprise data warehouse, BigQuery. When OSP was first developed, different product teams took charge of different parts of the platform, enabling them to work quickly and independently. Each of these product teams had its own data analysts, who were developing their own data marts in BigQuery, relating to their own product, and using Looker Studio to visualize the results. However, because there was no common set of business logic or definitions being used by all analysts, this resulted in inconsistent reporting across product teams, with inconsistent data and insights on the same subject. This eroded trust in the reports, meaning that when separate product teams needed to work together, it was not only hard to agree on the issue they were trying to solve, they also wasted time trying to understand the source of the problem.\nOcado Technology realized it needed an enterprise grade business intelligence (BI) tool with a robust semantic layer to ensure consistency in how metrics are defined and used across the organization. The company evaluated Looker and a third-party BI tool. Impressed with how comprehensive and powerful Looker\u2019s semantic layer was, it implemented Looker in 2023 and set about migrating its reports to the platform.\n\u201cOur data gives us a market advantage, but we have to access and process that data effectively,\u201d says Duncan Thompson, Data Ops Lead Analytics at Ocado Technology. \u201cInvesting in Looker has proven to be absolutely the right decision for us. It\u2019s a great proposition because it has enabled us to drive consistency across a huge range of metrics we previously had to spend time reconciling manually. It\u2019s a double whammy \u2014 we get consistency, and we\u2019re more efficient as we only have to build and define metrics once before we can use them again and again.\u201d\nOcado Technology now has over 2,000 employees regularly accessing Looker, with nine analyst teams and 700 active weekly users taking advantage of its self-serve functionality to build and share reports. Generated from the freshest data available in BigQuery, these reports mean the company can now access accurate and consistent insights, based on near-real-time data, helping it to optimize the OSP and improve the services it offers to its retail partners.\nFor example, one element of OSP is the customer-facing webshop that shoppers use to place their orders. This includes a search functionality to help users find goods to fill their baskets. One of Ocado Technology\u2019s product teams continually analyzes the performance of search to ensure it\u2019s working effectively. Previously, when these teams noticed an issue with search performance, such as a search term returning no results, they would need a data analyst to analyze the cause of the issue.\nThis time-consuming process slowed the team\u2019s ability to improve the partner\u2019s search performance, and also meant the data analyst\u2019s time was taken up answering ad hoc requests, diverting them from higher-value data projects. Now, those product teams can self-serve this information directly from Looker, enabling them to fix "

      "content": "Smart, scalable, seamless: online grocery fulfilment the Ocado way\nOnline grocery is one of the most complex channels in retail. Tight margins, complex operations and rising customer expectations around freshness, speed, cost and accuracy all put pressure on grocers to manage their supply chains with maximum efficiency. That\u00e2s why getting fulfilment right isn\u00e2t just a nice-to-have, it\u00e2s the foundation of sustainable online growth.\nOcado\u00e2s products have developed significantly since we first started licensing our technology internationally in 2017. They have expanded to reflect the wide range of partners that we have today, and the wide variety of markets we operate in.\u00c2\nThey also reflect our increased ability to meet retailers wherever they are on their ecommerce journey, at any level of business maturity, and a wide range of market scenarios.\nOur partners can deploy fulfilment networks ranging from AI-powered fulfilment software in stores and dark stores, to store automation or a range of fully automated CFCs ranging from the micro, to the very large, and anything in between.\u00c2\nCrucially, we work with our partners to shape the right mix based on their goals and operating environment in different geographies, as well as their overall long-term strategy.\nWe believe that no other provider offers the same breadth of solutions, the same level of end-to-end integration or the same depth of expertise. With over 25 years shaping the future of online grocery, Ocado knows what works, what scales and what delivers.\nIn this article, we\u00e2ll explore how our flexible fulfilment toolkit helps retailers succeed in a variety of real-world scenarios, and why getting the mix right is critical to profitable, scalable online grocery that exceeds customer expectations.\nDesigning for local conditions\nThe conditions that shape success in online grocery fulfilment, from customer expectations and product range, to volumes to labour costs, to catchment densities and store estates, vary widely between countries, regions and even cities.\nRetailers need the flexibility to respond to local dynamics and to evolve their operations as demand, economics and competition develops. At Ocado Group, we help partners do just that.\nWhether it\u00e2s deploying automated CFCs to meet and serve dense, fast-growing demand with maximum efficiency, or launching a manual store fulfilment service to suit a lower labour cost or lower density market, we partner with grocery retailers to design, deploy and refine their fulfilment strategy in every scenario.\u00c2\nOur fulfilment solutions are underpinned by the end-to-end Ocado Smart Platform, enabling them to work together seamlessly, unlocking efficiencies not just in fulfilment, but across the entire grocery supply chain.\nWorking with our partners\nBon Preu: Building an online grocery service from the ground up\n\u00e2\nBon Preu, a Catalonian grocery retailer, wanted to build an online grocery operation almost from scratch. The goal was to launch quickly across the market, and scale sustainably\nBon Preu partnered with Ocado Group in 2017, becoming our first international partner. It launched its online business using Ocado\u00e2s In-Store Fulfilment (ISF) solution, enabling orders to be picked and dispatched from existing stores.\nAs demand accelerated, Bon Preu added two dark stores (dedicated facilities designed exclusively for manual online fulfilment) also powered by Ocado\u00e2s ISF technology. The business has since grown well ahead of the wider online channel in Spain and has become the leading online grocery proposition in Catalonia, recognised by the OCU in 2024 as the highest-rated online grocery service in Spain.\nIn 2025, Bon Preu announced plans to open a Customer Fulfilment Centre (CFC) in Parets del Vall\u00c3\u00a8s. The new automated facility will enable Bon Preu customers to benefit from an even broader range, greater freshness and higher perfect order rate. It will also bring the significant cost efficiencies of Ocado's robotic automation and a pathway to fully-costed online grocery profitability.\nBon Preu is an example of a retailer using the full strategic toolkit that Ocado offers. They have already developed a market-leading online proposition in Catalonia with Ocado's In-Store Fulfilment technology and will now benefit from a highly automated CFC, offering an enhanced customer proposition and a significantly lower cost-to-serve.\u00c2\nThis journey demonstrates how Ocado enables a retailer like Bon Preu to launch quickly, scale with confidence, and evolve their fulfilment strategy in line with growth.\nColes: Scaling from manual to automated fulfilment\nColes, one of Australia\u00e2s largest grocery retailers, had built a large online grocery business and wanted to transition large volumes from manual fulfilment into world leading automation in Victoria and New South Wales\nWe have leveraged our automated CFCs, our software platform, and partner success teams to support Coles in more efficiently serving their shoppers in those key markets"
