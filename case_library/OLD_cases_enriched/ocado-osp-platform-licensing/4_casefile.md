# Case File: Ocado's AI-Powered Grocery Fulfillment Platform Licensing

## Executive Summary

Ocado has transformed from a UK online grocery retailer into a global technology platform provider through its Ocado Smart Platform (OSP). The company now licenses its AI-powered fulfillment technology to 13 retailers worldwide, including major players like Kroger in the USA and AEON in Japan. This represents a fundamental business model transformation from direct retail operations to technology platform licensing.

The OSP combines artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation technology to manage everything from ecommerce to fulfillment, logistics, and supply chains. Ocado's platform demonstrates massive operational scale, with their latest warehouse capable of processing over 200,000 orders per week, making it the world's largest facility for online grocery. The platform has enabled client success stories like Bon Preu in Spain, which became the leading online grocery proposition in Catalonia and was recognized as the highest-rated online grocery service in Spain by OCU in 2024.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Deployment Speed Improvement (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Dramatic reduction in deployment time from over a month to under a week
- **Evidence**: "I've seen features go from development to production inside of a week now. In the old world, a new application deployment could easily take over a month."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: This describes internal DevOps efficiency improvements, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: Move to Tier 1 operational improvements category

**C2 - Deployment Frequency Increase (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Massive increase in deployment frequency from 2 per week to dozens per week
- **Evidence**: "because there are no longer restrictive deployment windows in the warehouses, the rate of deployments has gone from as few as two per week to dozens per week"
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Increased deployment frequency is process optimization, not transformation of how Ocado creates value
- **Recommendation**: Reclassify as Tier 1 operational improvement

**C3 - Hardware Resource Reduction (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: 15-25% reduction in hardware resource usage
- **Evidence**: "I'd estimate that we use about 15-25% less hardware resources to host the same applications in Kubernetes in our test environments."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Hardware resource reduction is cost optimization, not strategic transformation
- **Recommendation**: Move to Tier 1 efficiency improvements

**C4 - Infrastructure Consolidation (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Infrastructure consolidation from 10 clusters to 1 cluster
- **Evidence**: "We have more confidence in the resource allocation/separation features of Kubernetes, so we have been able to migrate from around 10 fleet clusters to one Kubernetes cluster."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Infrastructure consolidation is internal IT optimization, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: Reclassify as Tier 1 operational improvement

**C5 - Platform Scale and Market Leadership (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Platform manages tens of thousands of orders weekly with world's largest online grocery facility capacity
- **Evidence**: "the platform is live in Ocado's warehouses, managing tens of thousands of orders a week. At full capacity, Ocado's latest warehouse in Erith, southeast London, will deliver more than 200,000 orders per week, making it the world's largest facility for online grocery."

**C6 - Self-Service Analytics Adoption (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: 700 weekly active users generate self-service insights
- **Evidence**: "700 weekly active users generate their own insights with Looker's extensive self-serve functionality"
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Self-service analytics adoption is internal efficiency improvement, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: Move to Tier 1 operational improvements

**C7 - Reporting Capability Development (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Built external reporting capability in 3 months
- **Evidence**: "Builds external reporting capability in just three months thanks to Looker's reusable metric definitions"
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Building reporting capability quickly is operational efficiency, not strategic transformation
- **Recommendation**: Reclassify as Tier 1 operational improvement

**C8 - Employee Platform Adoption (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Over 2,000 employees regularly access the platform with 9 analyst teams
- **Evidence**: "Ocado Technology now has over 2,000 employees regularly accessing Looker, with nine analyst teams and 700 active weekly users taking advantage of its self-serve functionality"
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Employee platform adoption is internal efficiency, not transformation of external value creation
- **Recommendation**: Move to Tier 1 internal capability building

**C9 - Metric Reusability Efficiency (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Efficiency gains from building metrics once and reusing them
- **Evidence**: "It's a double whammy — we get consistency, and we're more efficient as we only have to build and define metrics once before we can use them again and again."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Metric reusability is internal efficiency improvement, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: Reclassify as Tier 1 operational improvement

**C10 - Client Market Leadership Success (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Bon Preu became leading online grocery service in Catalonia and highest-rated in Spain
- **Evidence**: "The business has since grown well ahead of the wider online channel in Spain and has become the leading online grocery proposition in Catalonia, recognised by the OCU in 2024 as the highest-rated online grocery service in Spain."
