# Case File: Wimbledon AI Fan Engagement and Player Protection

## Executive Summary

The All England Lawn Tennis Club has implemented comprehensive AI systems at Wimbledon to enhance both fan engagement and player protection. The initiative includes AI chatbots and real-time win predictions to bring fans closer to the action, while simultaneously deploying the Threat Matrix system to protect players from online abuse across 35 languages. This dual approach demonstrates how AI can simultaneously improve customer experience and provide critical safety measures in high-profile sporting events.

The implementation represents a significant shift from reactive to proactive player protection, with AI monitoring over 1.6 million social media posts and identifying abuse patterns that would be impossible to detect manually. The broader implications extend beyond tennis, highlighting how AI-powered reputation management has become essential for organizations where reputation can account for up to 63% of market value.
