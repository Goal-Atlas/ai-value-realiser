# Deutsche Bank AI Research Tool - Report Creation Time Reduction

## Executive Summary

Deutsche Bank successfully deployed DB Lumina, an AI-powered research agent that transforms how financial analysts create research reports and conduct data analysis. After 12 months of development, the tool was adopted by hundreds of research analysts and delivers significant productivity improvements through automated data analysis, streamlined workflows, and enhanced content generation capabilities.

The implementation demonstrates measurable impact in reducing manual processes and outsourcing reliance while maintaining stringent data privacy requirements for the regulated financial sector. DB Lumina features conversational AI interfaces, prompt templates for standardized workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture for enterprise knowledge integration.

Industry context suggests broader AI adoption across investment banking, with reports of 40-60% reductions in repetitive tasks and dramatic productivity multipliers, though some broader industry claims require additional verification.
