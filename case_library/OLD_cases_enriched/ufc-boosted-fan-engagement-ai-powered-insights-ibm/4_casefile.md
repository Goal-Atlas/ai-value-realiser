# UFC Boosted Fan Engagement with AI-Powered Insights (IBM Partnership)

## Executive Summary

UFC and IBM have launched a comprehensive AI-powered partnership centered around the "In-Fight Insights" platform and UFC Insights Engine built with IBM watsonx. This collaboration represents a significant advancement in sports analytics, processing over 13.2 million UFC data points from 20+ years of fights and data from 2,400+ current and former athletes. The system delivers real-time insights during live events, transforming how fans experience UFC content across broadcast, digital, and social platforms.

The partnership addresses UFC's challenge of quickly transforming complex fight data into engaging, scalable content for over 40 annual live events. By leveraging IBM's Granite large language model and watsonx platform, the system provides both deep analysis and fast processing simultaneously - a capability that traditionally required choosing one or the other.

**Key outcomes include:**
- Real-time AI-driven alerts for notable milestones, streaks, and records during fights
- Enhanced viewing experiences for both hardcore and casual fans
- Integrated insights across pre-event programming, live broadcasts, social media, and in-venue displays
- New engagement opportunities across the entire UFC event lifecycle
