# Burberry: Optimized Production Schedules & Raw Material Waste Reduction

## Executive Summary

This case file examines Burberry's sustainability initiatives focused on production optimization and waste reduction. The luxury fashion house has implemented comprehensive measures including 100% organic cotton sourcing for Heritage Trench Coats, renewable energy adoption at manufacturing sites, and ambitious emissions reduction targets. However, the company has faced significant challenges with inventory management, having destroyed $40M worth of merchandise in 2017. Burberry's commitment to sustainability is demonstrated through its pioneering £300M sustainability bond - the first in the fashion industry - which was heavily oversubscribed, indicating strong investor confidence in their environmental strategy.

Key achievements include transitioning to 100% renewable electricity at Yorkshire manufacturing sites, implementing bio-based materials (90% bio-based resin buttons), and establishing circular economy services through ReBurberry initiatives. The company has also strengthened its emissions targets, increasing Scope 3 reduction goals from 30% to 46% by 2030, leveraging long-standing supplier relationships to facilitate these improvements.
