# Team Liquid: AI-Powered Esports Analytics Transformation

## Executive Summary

Team Liquid, one of the world's premier esports organizations, has achieved significant operational improvements through their partnership with SAP and implementation of AI-powered analytics solutions. The organization has transformed their data analysis processes from manual, time-intensive operations to instant, AI-driven insights using SAP's Joule Agents and Business Technology Platform.

Key achievements include reducing match preparation time from four days to one hour, enabling instant access to critical game statistics and player performance data, and eliminating manual data retrieval processes. The system processes over 1.6 TB of data from 10 million games, handling 50,000 data points per match across 20,000 daily games. This transformation has contributed to Team Liquid's continued success, with over $43 million in prize money and 120 major titles won since 2000.
