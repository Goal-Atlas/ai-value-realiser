# Case File: CarMax's AI-Powered Vehicle Inspection and Appraisal Systems

## Executive Summary

CarMax has deployed AI-powered vehicle inspection and appraisal systems to optimize its used car operations across retail and wholesale channels. The company partnered with UVeye to implement AI inspection technology that scans vehicles in seconds, producing detailed condition reports with high-resolution imagery while detecting damage, leaks, and missing parts. This technology enhances transparency for wholesale buyers and supports repair shop recommendations.

Beyond physical inspections, CarMax has integrated AI throughout its digital infrastructure, including its virtual assistant Skye for customer service automation and AI-enhanced appraisal systems that improve accuracy and speed. The company completed over 14 million online appraisals in fiscal 2024, demonstrating significant scale in digital customer engagement. These AI implementations focus on optimizing existing operational processes rather than transforming CarMax's fundamental business model of buying and selling used vehicles.
