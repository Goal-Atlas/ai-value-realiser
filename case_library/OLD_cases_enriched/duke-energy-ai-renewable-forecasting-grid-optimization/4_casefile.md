# Duke Energy AI Renewable Forecasting and Grid Optimization Case File

## Executive Summary

Duke Energy has developed and patented an Advanced Power Distribution Platform that leverages AI and machine learning to optimize grid operations and integrate renewable energy sources. The platform, patented in August 2024, creates computer models of grid components to predict and proactively resolve potential issues while managing the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles.

The system demonstrates significant capabilities in load forecasting, automated problem resolution, and demand management. Key innovations include the ability to automatically identify solutions for equipment overloads, generate hourly forecasts for renewable energy integration, and manage EV charging to reduce peak demand. Duke Energy is also investing heavily in battery energy storage systems (BESS) as part of their broader grid modernization strategy, with particular focus on sodium-sulfur battery technology for long-duration storage.

The initiative supports Duke Energy's 2050 zero-carbon goal while maintaining grid reliability and affordability for customers. The platform represents a shift toward more decentralized, resilient energy systems that leverage customer-owned assets like rooftop solar and home batteries.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Customer Impact and Cost Benefits ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: The platform reduces customer impact and makes electricity more reliable and less expensive

**Evidence**: John Pressley, managing director of clean energy digital strategy and engineering, explicitly states the platform's dual purpose of optimizing the grid to reduce customer impact while making electricity more reliable and less expensive through customer partnerships.

**Assessment**: Well-supported claim with clear articulation of customer benefits from a senior technical leader.

### C2: Proactive Problem Resolution ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: The platform enables proactive problem resolution and automatic identification of solutions

**Evidence**: The platform demonstrates concrete capabilities including automatic detection of equipment overloads and identification of solutions like power rerouting. It also generates hourly forecasts to help engineers identify distributed energy sources during high-demand periods.

**Assessment**: Strong technical evidence with specific examples of automated problem-solving capabilities.

### C3: Grid Management Efficiency ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim**: The platform enables more efficient grid management for customers

**Evidence**: Quote from John Pressley describing the patent as a "bucket list item" for managing the grid more efficiently for customers.

**Assessment**: While the quote supports the claim, it lacks specific technical details about what "more efficient" means in measurable terms. The statement is more aspirational than descriptive of concrete capabilities.

### C4: Renewable Integration with Reliability ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: The platform maintains grid reliability while keeping costs affordable as renewables are added

**Evidence**: The platform gives engineers confidence that as intermittent renewables are added, the grid can flex up and down to maintain reliability while keeping costs affordable for customers.

**Assessment**: Clear statement of the platform's ability to balance renewable integration with reliability and cost management.

### C5: Demand Management Benefits ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Managed charging reduces infrastructure burden and saves customers money

**Evidence**: The platform's managed charging capability shifts EV charging demand away from peak periods, reducing unnecessary burden on utility infrastructure while saving customers money on energy bills.

**Assessment**: Specific mechanism (demand shifting) with clear dual benefits for both infrastructure and customer costs.

### C6: Green Revolution Cost Reduction ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**Claim**: The green revolution will cost significantly less by utilizing existing customer assets

**Evidence**: Pressley states that the cost of the green revolution will be "way less" because the platform utilizes assets that already exist at people's homes.

**Assessment**: While the concept is sound, the claim makes a broad assertion about overall costs that would be difficult to verify without specific data or comparative analysis.

### C7: Human-Machine Collaboration ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Human-machine collaboration drives productivity, safety, and quality improvements

**Evidence**: Conference materials explicitly state that effective human-machine collaboration drives productivity, safety, and quality of work effort, producing better outcomes and offering advantages to both workers and utilities.

**Assessment**: Clear statement of benefits from human-machine collaboration in utility operations.

### C8: Battery Storage Grid Benefits ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Battery storage enhances grid reliability and resilience while supporting clean energy transition

**Evidence**: Duke Energy's battery storage commitment is explicitly described as enhancing grid reliability and resilience while paving the way for a more sustainable energy future.

**Assessment**: Direct statement linking battery storage investments to reliability, resilience, and sustainability goals.

### C9: Battery Technology for Grid Stability ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Battery storage provides grid stability and supports greater renewable energy integration

**Evidence**: The Suwannee site's 5-MW sodium-sulfur battery system with eight hours of storage demonstrates the potential for grid stability and renewable energy integration support.

**Assessment**: Concrete technical specifications supporting the claimed capabilities.

### C10: Residential Battery Storage Impact ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Residential battery storage empowers homeowners and contributes to grid stability

**Evidence**: The PowerPair program and increasing adoption of residential battery storage empowers homeowners to control their energy consumption while contributing to grid stability.

**Assessment**: Clear connection between residential programs and both customer empowerment and grid benefits.
