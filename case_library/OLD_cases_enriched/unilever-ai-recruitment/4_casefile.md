# Case File: Unilever's AI-Powered Recruitment Process Optimization

## Executive Summary

Unilever transformed its recruitment process by implementing AI-powered video interviewing and candidate screening technologies, addressing significant inefficiencies in their traditional hiring practices. The company previously required 4-6 months to process 250,000 applications to hire 800 individuals through manual, paper-based processes. By partnering with AI vendors including HireVue, Pymetrics, and Amberjack, Unilever created a streamlined digital recruitment pipeline featuring neuroscience-based assessments, AI-driven video interviews, and automated candidate filtering.

The implementation delivered substantial operational improvements across multiple metrics. The company achieved over 50,000 hours in time savings over 18 months, generated £1 million in annual cost savings, and dramatically improved process efficiency with a 90% reduction in time-to-hire. Additionally, the AI system enhanced candidate experience with completion rates increasing from 50% to 96%, while simultaneously improving hiring quality through a 16% increase in diversity hires and the ability to automatically filter 80% of the candidate pool.
