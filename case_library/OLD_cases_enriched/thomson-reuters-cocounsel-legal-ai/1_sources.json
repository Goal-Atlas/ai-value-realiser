      "content": "Case study\nTurbocharging legal tasks with CoCounsel generative AI\nEstablished in 2002, leading U.S. housebuilder Century Communities is based in Colorado but operates across the U.S. and has around 1,800 employees. Its 17-strong innovative legal team, using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) solutions from Thomson Reuters CoCounsel, including CoCounsel Core,, Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel, Practical Law, and CoCounsel Drafting. Along with the first GenAI assistant built for legal professionals, these tools improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of legal tasks such as reviewing contracts, summarizing documents, extracting data from large volumes of files, and drafting.\nWhen selecting AI-based tools for the legal department, Century Communities prioritized efficiency gains from a trusted provider. The company had been using Westlaw and Practical Law solutions for many years, and it was also using Thomson Reuters HighQ for contract lifecycle management, including automated contract creation. As these products developed with more sophisticated features, using GenAI capabilities felt like a natural progression to Jarrett Coleman, General Counsel at Century Communities. After a short demonstration of CoCounsel Core, he says, \"I felt like CoCounsel might be a game-changer for us.\" He was proved right.\nSwift summaries and contract review\n\u201cThere\u2019s way more to it now, but the genesis for me was the ability to take a ton of data and summarize it quickly and then spit out a link to where it found that data so you can do your own double checking. That\u2019s what really sparked my interest,\u201d explains Coleman.\nHe and his team began by giving CoCounsel Core datasets they were familiar with and posing questions to which they already knew the answers. This approach helped them build trust in the accuracy of the outputs, allowing them to accurately gauge how much faster outcomes were being delivered. The results were impressive.\nThe company\u2019s use of Thomson Reuters CoCounsel GenAI tools demonstrate how powerful they are at scale. In one example, the company was undertaking a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transaction with 87 different land contracts attached to it and used CoCounsel Core to take a\u201d first pass\u201d at summarizing the documents as part of the due diligence process and organize the insights into a usable format, eliminating the need for a lawyer to read through each one individually. This approach was so successful that the project was completed by a summer law student intern without any help from the lawyers. As a result, the solution facilitated document management and review by making it easier to find the relevant information about a particular deal easily later.\nClever drafting and easy answers\nCoCounsel Gen AI solutions are also excellent for details. Century Communities finds them very helpful for drafting specific contract clauses or as a starting point for crafting communications. For example, using CoCounsel Drafting GenAI skills, the legal team can ask it to improve on a clause, rewrite a specific section of a contract, or make a letter more cordial or assertive.\n\u201cWe were doing a master landlord agreement, and the ability to review a data set and have it provide answers for consideration, I thought was really cool and saved a ton of time on drafting.\u201d\nThe solutions are also valuable for providing quick, trustworthy answers and insights in areas where the team lacks specific legal expertise. For example, if the legal department is working on a contract that falls outside its usual day-to-day experience, it uses Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set with CoCounsel to suggest clauses and solutions. Or if it needs to understand a statute in a state it is less familiar with, it uses Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel to pull answers to its questions. In both cases, this reduces the need to ask outside counsel for advice.\nAn invaluable assistant\nColeman likens Thomson Reuters CoCounsel to having a personal assistant that provides gentle prompts to ensure lawyers have considered all the angles. He says, \u201cIt's nice when you can't come up with an answer off the top of your head, and it's able to spark something to get you drafting in the right direction. It also provides a nice double check and cuts down on errors. It'll find things that you may have missed when you\u2019re trying to read something cold.\u201d\nCentury Communities\u2019 legal team has found the solutions intuitive and easy to use. The more their legal team incorporates Thomson Reuters legal solutions into their working life, the more they discover the true breadth of what they can do. And they have learned that the more specific questions they ask of the tools, the better results they generate.\nGetting AI to do some of the heavy lifting allows lawyers to be more productive in other areas of their work. In Coleman\u2019s view, \u201cIf you're not spending your time reading stuff with a fine-tooth comb and you let it take the first shot at summarizing or reviewing, then yo"

      "content": "What to know:\n- To serve more of those in their community requiring help with problems such as domestic violence, homelessness prevention, and guardianship, the Legal Aid Society of San Bernardino staff needed to work more efficiently and thoroughly, without additional resources.\n- They chose the AI legal assistant CoCounsel to assess cases more quickly, provide sound legal advice \u2014 often on the spot \u2014 and make better use of staff and client time in referral clinics.\n- Their legal advice hotline receives nearly 27,000 calls every year \u2014 each requiring at least 30 minutes and sometimes up to an hour \u2014 handled by only two paralegals and two to three attorneys. Unfortunately, due to these resource constraints, almost 16,000 calls go unanswered.\n- With CoCounsel, Legal Aid Society of San Bernardino staff has been able to address 2x as many of the urgent cases\u2014such as those concerning eviction\u2014that come through the hotline. And they\u2019ve been able to onboard 20% more cases overall, going beyond simply providing advice to truly advocating for their clients, representing them for longer-term, more complex cases.\n- Being able to do more thorough work more quickly means the people they serve get badly needed resources, safety, and assistance sooner, for instance responding up to 90% faster to opposing counsel demands, which can mean preventing an eviction or getting someone back into their home days sooner.\nOpportunity: Expand service\nNonprofit Legal Aid Society of San Bernardino offers pro bono legal services in California\u2019s Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Committed to educating, empowering, and advocating for vulnerable individuals and communities, it takes requests for legal assistance through online applications and a hotline.\nIn the decades since its 1958 founding by a group of attorneys wanting to ensure justice wasn\u2019t hindered by financial constraints, Legal Aid Society has become indispensable to the communities it serves. Home to a population that\u2019s around 50% Latino \u2014 with 25% born outside the U.S. and 30% from limited-English-proficiency households \u2014 these counties have shown a high need for assistance in eviction, debt, and domestic violence, with women and Spanish-speaking families being the most impacted.\nIn 2024 alone, this small, 45-member team provided critical-level services to more than 22,000 people in more than 8,000 households. But the need for free legal help far outstrips what the team can supply. \u201cThe hardest part of my job is saying no to some clients. We don\u2019t say no because we don\u2019t care, we have to say no because we don\u2019t have enough resources to help them,\u201d says Executive Director Pablo Ramirez. \u201cThat\u2019s not what justice should be about.\u201d\nOf the nearly 27,000 calls to their hotline in 2024, almost 16,000 had to go unanswered. Most of these calls are from people facing urgent issues, such as being in danger of losing their home, facing abuse, or being in a life-or-death situation. Though not every call will develop into a longer-term case, the team\u2019s mission is to give sound, complete legal advice to everyone they talk with. But finding the right resources in the moment \u2014 and being certain they\u2019re current and accurate \u2014 is a challenge, so calls can sometimes take 30 minutes or more. Callers\u2019 questions also cover a broad range of legal topics, with some requiring specialized knowledge to answer. Doing right by each caller means, in effect, answering fewer calls than the team would like.\nOnce ChatGPT emerged, the team began to consider how AI might help, but with some reservations. \u201cAt first, I was very skeptical about AI, because of the need for confidentiality and the credibility of the platform. But I knew there had to be a better way to continue to serve more people,\u201d says Ramirez.\nSolution: Amplify impact\nThe Legal Aid Society team began using CoCounsel, a professional-grade AI legal solution, to essentially be their assistant on hotline calls. It offered capabilities they needed with the criteria they required: data security and privacy coupled with reliable, verified information. CoCounsel uses industry-leading security policies, standards, and practices. Its integration with Westlaw and Practical Law content means its answers can be trusted, backed as they are by the expertise of 1,200 attorney-editors.\nThey quickly discovered that having CoCounsel on hand as they answered calls allowed them to talk to nearly twice as many people who were calling with urgent issues. Not only that, but it helped the team handle, as Deputy Director Gregory Armstrong says, \u201cmany more varied and complex questions, some of which are unusual and would have taken an extremely long time to get thorough and accurate answers for.\u201d Plus, CoCounsel can return these legal research answers in minutes \u2014 sometimes seconds.\nFor some callers, the advice they receive on the phone is enough. Others need additional assistance, such as document handling or preparation, and some may even need representation. CoCounse"

      "content": "Thomson Reuters, a leading provider of information services for legal, tax, and accounting professionals, today announced the launch of CoCounsel, a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how lawyers research, analyze and draft legal documents. The company believes this technology is so powerful that it would be \"almost malpractice for lawyers not to use it,\" according to David Wong, Thomson Reuters Chief Product Officer, who remarked with a hint of jest at a recent press event in Downtown San Francisco.\nCoCounsel, developed through the acquisition of legal AI startup Casetext, uses advanced generative AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 to understand and process Thomson Reuters' vast proprietary content database. \"What is unique about many of our solutions is that we have designed generative AI solutions that mimic workflows that professionals use,\" explained Wong. \"We try to mimic the way that a professional does work, such that we can test and authenticate that the work product is equivalent to what you'd expect a human to do.\"\nThomson Reuters' new CoCounsel platform integrates essential legal tasks like research and document analysis with the company's extensive proprietary data, industry-leading AI, and third-party integrations to provide a comprehensive generative AI legal assistant. Credit: Thomson Reuters\nGrounding AI reasoning in reliable data\nJake Heller, former Casetext CEO and now Head of Product for CoCounsel, emphasized the importance of grounding the AI's reasoning in reliable data. \"CoCounsel leverages GPT-4 and all of the incredible reasoning capabilities of GPT-4, but it limits almost all of this reasoning to the domain of knowledge which we provide,\" said Heller. \"We are taking the incredibly smart and incredibly capable reasoning engine from OpenAI with GPT-4, but we're focusing in on the knowledge and data, which we provide it for when it is doing legal research.\"\nThis approach ensures that CoCounsel's outputs are not only accurate but also easily verifiable by legal professionals. By constraining the AI's knowledge base to Thomson Reuters' curated legal content, the company can provide a level of transparency and trustworthiness that is essential for the legal industry.\nCapitalizing on in-house expertise and exclusive data\nThomson Reuters benefits significantly from its internal resources and exclusive data collections. \"Since 2018, our focus has been on serving professionals like lawyers, accountants and compliance officers,\" Wong noted. He said the company employs over 2,400 legal and tax experts who consistently maintain and interpret the law, enriching Thomson Reuters' content and analytical capabilities.\nThis combination of proprietary data and expert knowledge uniquely positions Thomson Reuters to tailor its AI models to meet the nuanced demands of the legal profession.\nThe introduction of CoCounsel could significantly streamline many routine yet time-intensive tasks that lawyers encounter. By automating processes such as case law research and document drafting, the platform promises to reduce the workload on legal practitioners, allowing them to concentrate on more strategic aspects of their roles and enhance client service.\nCoCounsel, Thomson Reuters' generative AI legal assistant, automates essential tasks like drafting merger agreements and conducting legal research by leveraging the company's proprietary data and AI capabilities, as shown in this mockup of the platform in action. Credit: Thomson Reuters\nThe Future of Legal AI: Unleashing the Titans\nThomson Reuters' CoCounsel marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of legal AI, as established information services giants begin to flex their muscles in this burgeoning space. By combining cutting-edge generative AI with their extensive proprietary data and in-house expertise, Thomson Reuters has set a high bar for what legal professionals can expect from AI-powered tools.\nThe launch of CoCounsel is likely to spark a new wave of competition and innovation in the legal AI market. As rivals scramble to match or surpass CoCounsel, we can anticipate a rapid acceleration in the development of sophisticated, domain-specific AI solutions tailored to the unique needs of legal professionals.\nThis intensified competition bodes well for lawyers and their clients, as the increased pressure to innovate will drive the creation of ever more powerful and efficient AI tools. With each new entrant to the market, the potential for AI to revolutionize legal work grows, promising to streamline time-consuming tasks, increase accuracy, and allow lawyers to focus on higher-value activities.\nHowever, as the legal AI landscape evolves, concerns around security, privacy, and the ethical use of these technologies will only become more pressing. As AI takes on a greater role in sensitive legal matters, the need for robust safeguards and clear guidelines will be paramount. The success of legal AI will hinge not only on the power of the underly"
