# Case File: Thomson Reuters CoCounsel Legal AI

## Executive Summary

Thomson Reuters CoCounsel represents a significant advancement in AI-powered legal assistance, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains across multiple legal organizations. The platform leverages generative AI built on Thomson Reuters' proprietary legal content to automate document review, legal research, and drafting tasks that traditionally require extensive manual effort from legal professionals.

The implementation results show impressive operational improvements: Legal Aid Society of San Bernardino doubled their capacity to handle urgent cases while onboarding 20% more cases overall, and responded up to 90% faster to opposing counsel demands. Century Communities successfully completed M&A due diligence on 87 land contracts using a summer intern rather than experienced lawyers. Plante Moran scaled their user base by 450% after pilot testing, with 96% of users agreeing the tool is useful for practice staff and 91% reporting it's faster than traditional research methods.

These outcomes demonstrate CoCounsel's ability to significantly enhance legal workflow efficiency while maintaining quality and accuracy, positioning it as a transformative tool for legal practice optimization rather than business model disruption.

This approach was so successful that the project was completed by a summer law student intern without any help from the lawyers."
