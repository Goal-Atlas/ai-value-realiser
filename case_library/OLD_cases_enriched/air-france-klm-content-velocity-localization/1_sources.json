      "content": "How 100-year-old Air France-KLM saved $600,000/year and brought innovation to aviation with Atlassian Cloud Premium\nMigrating to Atlassian cloud was best for our community. We had a vision of supporting users with the most up-to-date versions, features and functionalities only available on cloud, like AI.\nJordy Essed\nDevNet Team Product Owner, Air France-KLM, Air France\n- $600k\n- Annual savings by migrating to Atlassian cloud\nAbout Air France\nChallenge: Air France-KLM wanted to shift resources from tool maintenance to innovation, and help teams across the organization collaborate and deliver more efficiently.\nSolution: Air France-KLM migrated from OpenStack and Atlassian Data Center to Atlassian Cloud Premium.\nImpact: By migrating to Atlassian Cloud Premium, Air France-KLM eliminated downtime, maintenance, and server costs, while supporting compliance and providing a better user experience.\nThe road to aviation wasn't paved by the Wright brothers alone. In the early 1900s, when blimps were all the rage, KLM left helium behind to reach new heights (and distances) with one of the first non-airship airlines. Over 100 years later, the company holds two impressive titles: the oldest airline in Europe and a leader in the competitive, fast-changing aviation industry.\nWhen KLM merged with Air France to become Air France-KLM, the two aviation leaders came together to provide the best service in the industry for three core enterprises: passenger travel, cargo, and engineering and maintenance. They deliver on that promise thanks to their focus on customer loyalty and their culture of innovation.\u00c2\nOver the years, Air France-KLM has been among the first to implement countless aviation advancements, from the latest sustainable biofuels and aircrafts like the Dreamliner, to cutting-edge operational tools and in-flight entertainment like personal virtual reality headsets.\u00c2\nTo keep up with these advancements and maintain their position as an industry leader, Air France-KLM modernized their development practices using Atlassian tools for collaboration and delivery. Since migrating from Atlassian Data Center to Atlassian Cloud Premium, the airline is saving over $600,000 every year, freeing up thousands of hours every day, and providing even better support for employees and customers.\nOther teams often come to us, asking to upgrade to Atlassian cloud because they see how it could improve their life and deliver a better experience. Now, we have more non-developer users on Atlassian than developers.\nNathan Wattimena\nScrum Master - RTE Next Generation Data Center Air France-KLM\nA cloud migration paves the (run)way for the future of aviation\nAir France-KLM\u00e2s investment in collaborative, efficient technology began in the late 90s and early 2000s, with Jira for issue tracking and Confluence for IT knowledge management. When the airline began adopting more modern practices in the 2010s, including agile and DevOps, teams expanded their use of Atlassian tools to support their work.\u00c2 \u00c2\nAs their Atlassian user base grew and their needs became more complex, Air France-KLM\u00e2s forward-looking IT team noticed several opportunities for improvement. Their goal was simple: Help teams across the organization collaborate and deliver more efficiently.\u00c2\nOne obstacle in meeting this goal was OpenStack, the platform Air France-KLM used to run their Atlassian Data Center instances. \u00e2We were losing a lot of time and resources just keeping the platform alive, not even adding functionalities,\u00e2 explains Manager of IT Operations Mohamed Haddadi. \u00e2There weren't enough engineers left who were knowledgeable about OpenStack, and it didn\u00e2t offer 90% of the integrations we needed.\u00e2\u00c2\nAt the same time, Air France-KLM was making an organizational shift to cloud technology. Migrating from Atlassian Data Center to Cloud was the obvious path forward. \u00e2We had a vision of supporting our users, developers, and product owners \u00e2 anyone who uses Jira and Confluence \u00e2 with the most up-to-date versions of those tools. There\u00e2s a whole list of valuable functionalities and use cases, like AI features, which are only available on Atlassian cloud,\u00e2 says Jordy Essed, a product owner for Air France-KLM\u00e2s DevNet team, which manages the company\u00e2s Atlassian toolstack and continuous improvement/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.\u00c2\nThe team also appreciated that working on the Atlassian cloud platform would ensure compliance with strict GDPR regulations. \u00e2Security and compliance were big reasons to choose Atlassian over a smaller company,\u00e2 Mohamed says.\nFinally, migrating to the cloud would help Air France-KLM attract top talent. \u00e2In the past five years, we've really focused on delivering value by delivering software,\u00e2 says Nathan Wattimena, a former product owner for the DevNet team, who\u00e2s now Scrum Master for the company\u00e2s Next Generation Data Center. \u00e2That meant hiring more DevOps engineers and creating more complex, collaborative workflows between dev and operations teams.\u00e2\u00c2\nJordy "

      "content": "At Air France-KLM, we\u2019re one of the global leaders in international air transport. Through our subsidiaries Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Transavia, we offer passenger services, cargo transport, and aircraft maintenance flights to over 300 destinations.\nTo transport our 83 million passengers a year, it\u2019s vital that we keep our modern fleet of 522 aircraft in top condition. Commercial aviation is one of the safest ways to travel for a very good reason; like all leading global airlines, Air France-KLM follows rigorous and tightly regulated inspection and maintenance processes for all aircraft and airside equipment.\nMaintaining a world-class fleet\nOur aircraft are made up of thousands of individual components, each of which requires planned as well as unplanned maintenance. Every asset inspection and repair we carry out is associated with documentation: maintenance manuals and tech logs, work instructions, engineering drawings, and much more. With reference to these documents, our mechanics and engineers can perform their duties safely, efficiently, and accurately.\nFor many years, all our documents were printed on paper, and our teams relied on hundreds of thousands of hard copies to do their work. New maintenance processes and airworthiness directives are released all the time\u2014and with so many paper copies, it was a major effort to keep our records up to date. What\u2019s more, the cost of storing all these paper documents was climbing and climbing every year. We knew we needed a different approach.\nDriving digital transformation\nThat\u2019s where our journey with OpenText\u2122 began. Working together, we switched from paper records to digital documents, managed securely and efficiently in OpenText\u2122 Documentum\u2122. For more than two decades, Documentum has acted as the single source of truth for all our maintenance and engineering content\u2014including data from industry vendors such as Airbus, Boeing, and General Electric.\nToday, 15,000 employees across the business rely on data in Documentum to perform their day-to-day work. For our aircraft engineers particularly, the solution had a massive impact on efficiency. Gone are the days of leafing through filing cabinets to find vital maintenance information\u2014today, all the information they need is right at their fingertips. They simply enter a part number into Documentum, and they can navigate to the associated records immediately.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which makes OpenText the perfect fit for our compliance needs. The solution offers a watertight audit trial for every user action, helping us to demonstrate to our regulators that we are following the proper procedures for our maintenance activities.\nSoaring into cloud\nDocumentum is such an important solution for our business that we continuously invest in extending and enhancing its capabilities. Over the years, we\u2019ve integrated Documentum with our core business systems, including SAP\u00ae ERP and Salesforce\u00ae. One of our most recent projects was deploying Documentum D2 SmartView\u2014a modern user experience that empowers our employees with personalized workspaces that make it even faster and easier to find the data they need. With some features still pending, we continue to partner with OpenText to help drive product roadmaps.\nAt the moment, we\u2019re planning our next big Documentum project\u2014a move to the cloud. By bringing the solution to Azure, we\u2019ll unlock all the familiar benefits of cloud: easier management and maintenance, lower infrastructure costs, and tighter information security. As an early adopter, Professional Services is helping us navigate vulnerabilities as we containerize in Azure.\nWorking with OpenText, we\u2019re going a step further. By deploying OpenText\u2122 Extended ECM Documentum\u2122 for SAP\u00ae Solutions alongside Documentum on the new cloud platform, we\u2019ll enable our users to access data from our information management system directly from their SAP applications.\nRead our case study to learn more"
