# Case File: Air France-KLM's Digital Content Management and Infrastructure Optimization

## Executive Summary

Air France-KLM has implemented multiple technology initiatives to optimize their digital content management and IT infrastructure operations. The airline partnered with Contentstack to modernize their digital experience platform, enabling more agile content delivery across global touchpoints and markets. This composable architecture approach allows the company to maintain consistent content while adapting quickly to changing customer needs.

The most significant quantified impact comes from their migration to Atlassian Cloud Premium, which generated $600,000 in annual savings while eliminating downtime and maintenance costs. Additionally, the company has leveraged OpenText Documentum for over two decades to digitize aircraft maintenance documentation, replacing hundreds of thousands of paper documents with digital workflows that provide immediate access to critical maintenance information for 15,000 employees.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Digital Experience Workflow Optimization (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Contentstack enables Air France-KLM to deliver superior digital experiences while benefiting from rapid, agile, and reliable internal workflows
- **Evidence**: "By harvesting the power of composable, headless technology, Air France-KLM is now better equipped to adapt to change without having to compromise on quality. In partnership with Contentstack, they're able to continue delivering superior digital experiences while benefiting from rapid, agile, and reliable internal workflows."
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Claims are vague ('superior digital experiences', 'rapid, agile workflows') without specific metrics or measurable outcomes
- **Recommendation**: Find quantified metrics on workflow speed improvements, content delivery efficiency, or time savings

**C2 - Content Consistency Across Markets (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Contentstack enables Air France-KLM to deliver more consistent content across all touchpoints and markets
- **Evidence**: "Migrating to Contentstack contributes to delivering more consistent content across all our touchpoints and all markets. At the same time, it enables us to integrate our existing tech stack and adapt quickly to the changing landscape."
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Describes specific process improvement (content consistency) but no quantified metrics on improvement achieved
- **Recommendation**: Obtain metrics on content consistency improvements, publishing speed, or market deployment efficiency

**C3 - Annual Cost Savings from Cloud Migration (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Air France-KLM saves $600,000 annually by migrating to Atlassian Cloud Premium
- **Evidence**: "Since migrating from Atlassian Data Center to Atlassian Cloud Premium, the airline is saving over $600,000 every year, freeing up thousands of hours every day, and providing even better support for employees and customers."

**C4 - Infrastructure Cost Elimination (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Air France-KLM eliminated downtime, maintenance, and server costs with Atlassian Cloud Premium
- **Evidence**: "By migrating to Atlassian Cloud Premium, Air France-KLM eliminated downtime, maintenance, and server costs, while supporting compliance and providing a better user experience."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Claims are qualitative ('eliminated downtime', 'better user experience') without specific metrics
- **Recommendation**: Obtain specific uptime metrics, maintenance cost elimination figures, or user satisfaction scores

**C5 - Daily Time Savings (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Air France-KLM freed up thousands of hours every day through the migration
- **Evidence**: "Since migrating from Atlassian Data Center to Atlassian Cloud Premium, the airline is saving over $600,000 every year, freeing up thousands of hours every day, and providing even better support for employees and customers."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: 'Thousands of hours daily' for one organization seems potentially inflated without methodology explanation
- **Recommendation**: Clarify calculation methodology and specify which processes or roles achieved these time savings

**C6 - Aircraft Engineer Efficiency Impact (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: OpenText Documentum had a massive impact on efficiency for Air France-KLM aircraft engineers
- **Evidence**: "For our aircraft engineers particularly, the solution had a massive impact on efficiency. Gone are the days of leafing through filing cabinets to find vital maintenance information—today, all the information they need is right at their fingertips."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Impact described qualitatively ('massive impact') without metrics
- **Recommendation**: Obtain quantified efficiency gains, time savings metrics, or document retrieval speed improvements

**C7 - Expected Cloud Migration Benefits (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Air France-KLM expects to achieve easier management, lower infrastructure costs, and tighter information security by moving Documentum to the cloud
- **Evidence**: "By bringing the solution to Azure, we'll unlock all the familiar benefits of cloud: easier management and maintenance, lower infrastructure costs, and tighter information security."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: These are projected benefits ('expects to achieve', 'we'll unlock') rather than realized outcomes
- **Recommendation**: Follow up post-migration to document actual benefits realized rather than projected benefits
