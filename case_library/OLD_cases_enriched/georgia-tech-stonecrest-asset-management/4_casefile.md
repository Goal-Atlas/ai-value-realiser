# Georgia Tech Stonecrest Asset Management Initiative

## Executive Summary

Georgia Institute of Technology partnered with Avid Solutions and IBM to implement a comprehensive asset management and energy infrastructure transformation in Stonecrest, Georgia. The initiative deployed IBM Maximo Application Suite and watsonx Orchestrate to address systemic challenges in infrastructure management, energy distribution, and workforce coordination. The project achieved significant operational improvements including 40% reduction in unplanned asset downtime, 60% decrease in manual field response times, and projected $2.3 million in cost avoidance over three years with a 10x return on investment. Additionally, the initiative created 120 new jobs in sustainability and smart infrastructure sectors.

## Detailed Findings

### Asset Management Performance (Claims C1-C2)
**Status: APPROVED**

The implementation of IBM Maximo Application Suite with predictive analytics capabilities delivered substantial improvements in asset management:
- **40% reduction in unplanned asset downtime across 3 counties** - Achieved through predictive analytics that enabled proactive maintenance scheduling
- **60% decrease in manual field response times** - Smart workflows powered by watsonx Orchestrate significantly improved operational agility

These metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of transitioning from reactive to predictive asset management approaches.

### Energy and Resource Efficiency (Claims C3-C4)
**Status: APPROVED**

The energy monitoring and automation systems produced measurable resource efficiency gains:
- **18% reduction in peak load costs** - Achieved through clean energy monitoring systems that optimized energy consumption patterns
- **30% decrease in water waste in agriculture** - Automation systems improved resource utilization in agricultural applications

These improvements align with the initiative's sustainability objectives and demonstrate practical environmental benefits.

### Implementation Efficiency (Claim C5)
**Status: APPROVED**

The project delivery showed significant improvement over previous implementations:
- **30% increase in deployment speed compared to previous projects** - The modular, API-driven architecture aligned with IBM protocols enabled faster implementation

This metric indicates improved project management capabilities and technology maturity.

### Financial Impact (Claim C6)
**Status: APPROVED**

The initiative projects substantial financial returns:
- **USD 2.3 million in cost avoidance over three years with 10x return on investment** - These are projected figures based on operational improvements and efficiency gains

The financial projections appear reasonable given the documented operational improvements across multiple metrics.

### Workforce Development (Claim C7)
**Status: APPROVED**

The project delivered significant local economic impact:
- **Creation of 120 new jobs in sustainability and smart infrastructure** - These positions support the initiative's focus on inclusive innovation and community development

This outcome aligns with the Partnership for Inclusive Innovation's mission and demonstrates tangible community benefits.

### Infrastructure Investment (Claims C8-C9)
**Status: C8 APPROVED, C9 REJECTED**

Regarding the Tech Square Microgrid project:
- **$4.8 million capital cost** - This figure is well-documented across multiple sources with regulatory approval context
- **Claim C9 rejected as duplicate** - Identical information from different source should be consolidated

The microgrid project represents a separate but related Georgia Tech energy infrastructure initiative.
