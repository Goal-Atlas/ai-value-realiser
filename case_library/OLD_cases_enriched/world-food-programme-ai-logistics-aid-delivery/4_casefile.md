# World Food Programme AI Logistics and Aid Delivery Case File

## Executive Summary

The World Food Programme (WFP), in collaboration with Google Research, has developed SKAI, an AI-powered platform that uses satellite imagery and machine learning to assess building damage and support humanitarian aid delivery during disasters. The system has been deployed in real-world scenarios including the 2023 Turkey earthquake and Hurricane Ian in 2022.

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- Assessed 600,000 buildings with 81% accuracy using only 5 team members
- Covered 530 km² of urban zones affecting 1.3 million people in under one week
- Identified over 28,000 heavily damaged or destroyed structures during Turkey earthquake response

**Evidence Quality:** Mixed - while specific deployment metrics are well-documented, broader claims about speed improvements and effectiveness lack quantifiable evidence.

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ APPROVED CLAIMS

**C3: SKAI achieved over 81% accuracy in assessing approximately 600,000 buildings with just 5 team members**
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Evidence:** Direct quote confirms "During a month-long deployment, SKAI's team of just five individuals demonstrated remarkable capabilities. They assessed approximately 600,000 buildings with an accuracy rate exceeding 81 percent."
- **Assessment:** Specific, verifiable metrics with clear timeframe and team size.

**C4: SKAI rapidly covered 530 km2 of urban zones affecting 1.3 million people in less than a week**
- **Status:** APPROVED  
- **Evidence:** Quote directly states "In less than a week, SKAI's agile technology covered an extensive area of 530 km2 comprising urban zones with an estimated population of 1.3 million people."
- **Assessment:** Concrete metrics with specific geographic and population scope.

**C5: SKAI identified over 28,000 heavily damaged or destroyed structures during Turkey earthquake response**
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Evidence:** Source confirms "This assessment helped identify over 28,000 heavily damaged or destroyed structures."
- **Assessment:** Specific, verifiable outcome from documented deployment.

### ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

**C1: SKAI significantly speeds up humanitarian assistance delivery to affected households after disasters**
- **Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
- **Issue:** Vague claim lacking quantifiable metrics or comparison baselines
- **Evidence Gap:** No specific timeframe improvements or before/after comparisons provided

**C2: SKAI enables rapid and accurate building damage assessment with unprecedented precision and speed**
- **Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
- **Issue:** Subjective language ("unprecedented") without benchmarks or comparative data
- **Evidence Gap:** No specific precision metrics or speed comparisons to existing methods

**C6: SKAI enables efficient resource allocation and targeted interventions through real-time monitoring**
- **Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
- **Issue:** Describes capability but lacks evidence of actual implementation effectiveness
- **Evidence Gap:** No measurable outcomes or efficiency improvements documented

**C7: SKAI helped effectively prioritize aid delivery during Hurricane Ian response**
- **Status:** NEEDS REVIEW
- **Issue:** Vague effectiveness claim without specific metrics
- **Evidence Gap:** No quantifiable outcomes or prioritization improvements provided
