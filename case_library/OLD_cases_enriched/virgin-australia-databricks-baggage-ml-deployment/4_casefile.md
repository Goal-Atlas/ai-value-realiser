# Virgin Australia Airlines: Databricks Data Platform Migration and ML Deployment

## Executive Summary

Virgin Australia Airlines successfully transformed its data strategy by migrating from an on-premises data warehouse to Databricks' cloud-based Data Intelligence Platform. This comprehensive transformation focused on building a trusted, governed central data repository that enabled improved collaboration, real-time reporting, and data-driven decision-making across the organization.

The implementation delivered significant operational improvements, including a 75% increase in real-time data availability, a 44% reduction in mishandled baggage, and a 25% revenue boost attributed to analytics insights. The airline also achieved a 90% faster deployment of machine learning models and implemented a near-real-time Baggage Reconciliation System that enhanced both operational efficiency and customer experience.

**Key Achievements:**
- 75% increase in real-time data availability
- 44% decrease in mishandled baggage
