      "content": "New Marriott Bonvoy Research reveals importance of AI for holiday planning and new trends for 2026\n- 24 October 2025\n- Research amongst more than 22,000 travellers across Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) shows that 79% of travellers plan to go on more or the same amount of holidays in 2026 compared to 2025\n- Lux-scaping \u2013 travellers booking a luxurious stay as an elevated travel indulgence at the start or end of their holidays \u2013 is identified as a key travel trend for 2026\n- Travel for musical, cultural or sporting events inspires the trend for \u2018Passion Pursuits\u2019 particularly popular amongst Gen Z and millennials\nLondon, 24 October 2025 \u2013 Four in five (79%) travellers in EMEA intend to go on more or the same amount of holidays in 2026 compared to 2025, including 39% who plan to go on an increased number, according to new industry research conducted by Mortar, of more than 22,000 adults across 11 key travel markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nFigures from the research, included in Marriott Bonvoy\u2019s 2026 EMEA Ticket to Travel Report, suggest continued overall momentum for the region\u2019s travel sector next year. The average traveller in EMEA is planning five holidays in 2026, with two domestic holidays within their own country, two short-haul breaks (a four-hour flight or less) and one long haul trip.\nAccording to Marriott Bonvoy booking data analysis, trending destinations for EMEA consumers in 2026 are Oslo in Norway, Algiers in Algeria, Muscat in Oman, Split and Zagreb in Croatia, and Copenhagen in Denmark.\nTrust in AI builds\nArtificial intelligence has become a core component of trip planning for millions of consumers in EMEA, with half of all travellers in the research (50%) saying they have used AI to plan or research a holiday - this is up from 41% last year and just 26% the year before, showing a strong rise in two years. Almost one in seven (14%) say they use it \u2018all the time\u2019 for travel planning.\nThose aged 18-24 are most likely to have used it previously (71%), while those aged 25-34 are most likely to use it \u2018all the time\u2019 (24%). However, older travellers are using AI too - three in ten (29%) of those aged 55-64 have \u2013 up from 18% last year.\nReinforcing the increased familiarity and trust travellers are placing in AI, half (50%) say that in future they would feel \u2018comfortable\u2019 booking holiday accommodation through AI platforms. Just 18% say the idea makes them \u2018uncomfortable\u2019.\nThe rise of \u2018lux-scaping\u2019\nA growing travel trend revealed in the EMEA research is \u2018lux-scaping \u2013 when travellers treat themselves to a luxurious experience like a spa or hotel stay for a few days at the start or end of their trip.\nSix in ten (59%) have previously done this, with more than one in five consumers (22%) having done it in the past 12 months \u2013 showing how travellers are trying to both indulge themselves with a moment of luxury and make their travel budgets go further.\nLux-scaping is particularly popular amongst younger travellers in the EMEA region, with 35% of 25-34 year olds and 29% of 18-24 year olds having done this in the past year alone.\nConsumers highlight the benefits of lux-scaping with nearly half (46%) saying it can help them to \u2018relax and get into the holiday mindset\u2019 at the start of a break, while 43% say that a luxury stay at the end of a holiday helps them go home feeling refreshed.\nIn addition, three in ten (29%) say it allows them to experience a level of luxury that they may not be able to afford for a longer break.\nGrowing influence of passion led travel\nPassion pursuits - where travellers go on a holiday primarily to follow a passion - is also identified as a key trend for 2026 in EMEA. Almost seven in ten travellers (68%) say they have done this previously, with a third of these (33%) typically doing this at least once a year.\nTravelling to see or participate in a music or cultural event was found to be the passion which travellers in the region are most likely to base a holiday around at 48%. This was closely followed by going away to watch or participate in a sport at 47%. Going away to explore or do something adventurous - such as a safari or a trek was at 39%.\nThe younger generation are fully embracing passion pursuits, with 82% of Gen Z saying they have been on a passion pursuit holiday, 77% for millennials and 63% for Gen X in the last year alone.\nCountry hopping on the rise\nCountry hopping - visiting multiple countries (at least two countries) within one trip - is also set to increase in popularity among EMEA travelers for 2026. Over half of surveyed travellers (52%) say they \u2018probably or definitely\u2019 will do this next year. The trend was again found to be most prominent for those within the 25-34 age range, where two thirds (66%) plan to do this in 2026. While typically more commonplace in the Middle East and Africa, this is a rising trend among European travellers.\nThe need for accommodation to be \u2018accommodating\u2019\nWhile cleanliness (89%), price (88%) and location (87%) rema"

      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy, a luxury home rental offering, is testing an AI search tool designed to provide customers with personalized rental options from a pool of 140,000 properties. The tool also offers advice for nearby activities based on the chosen destination.\n- Developed in partnership with Publicis Sapient, the search tool can accept natural language queries, making question asking easier.\n- The AI search tool launched on the Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy website last week and will roll out to the mobile app in the coming weeks. Travelers can still choose to use Marriott Bonvoy\u2019s traditional search engine if they prefer.\nDive Insight:\nMarriott is the latest company to embrace the power of AI as a tool to make searches more intuitive while delivering highly personalized results, following companies like Walmart and Victoria\u2019s Secret earlier this year.\nMarriott\u2019s test will showcase how AI can help travelers refine their plans. The new search function can offer relevant information such as the weather forecast for the trip and make suggestions based on a customers\u2019 interests, including options for hiking, sightseeing or dining.\nThe search engine can also suggest vacation rentals based on preferred amenities rather than specific destinations. Customers can include as little or as much detail as they\u2019d like, and the AI tool will offer suggestions that meet as many of the descriptors in their query as possible.\nWhen searched for the \u201cBest A-frame home in the mountains with a fireplace and stunning view,\u201d the tool brought up relevant rental options from North Carolina, California and beyond.\nRetailers are particularly interested in AI-powered search technology. More than a quarter of retail leaders foresee AI expanding its role in search experiences, according to a study released by Algolia and Coleman Parkes Research last month.\nHowever, the impact won\u2019t be limited to retail. As AI-powered search spreads, it is expected to raise the bar for search across all industries as customers come to expect the enhanced personalization it offers."
