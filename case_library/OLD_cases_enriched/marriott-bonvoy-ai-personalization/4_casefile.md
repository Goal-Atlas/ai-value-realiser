# Case File: Marriott International's AI-Powered Travel Personalization and Search

## Executive Summary

Marriott International is implementing AI-powered personalization and search capabilities across its hospitality platform to optimize guest experiences and booking processes. The company has deployed Adobe Experience Cloud to enable personalized customer journeys at scale across its portfolio of 30+ brands and nearly 8,800 properties. Additionally, Marriott is testing an AI search tool for its Homes & Villas luxury rental service that provides personalized recommendations from 140,000 properties using natural language processing.

These AI implementations focus on optimizing existing business functions including search and discovery, customer personalization, and loyalty program engagement. The technology enables Marriott to match guests with appropriate accommodations based on individual preferences while supporting direct bookings and loyalty expansion across their extensive property network.
