# Case File: Recursion Pharmaceuticals' AI-Enabled Drug Discovery Platform

## Executive Summary

Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed an AI-enabled drug discovery platform that fundamentally transforms the pharmaceutical R&D process by combining experimental biology, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence. The company's approach represents a shift from traditional sequential trial-and-error methods to a scalable, data-driven search problem, targeting the creation of treatments for rare diseases that typically lack viable development paths.

The platform has demonstrated significant achievements in accelerating drug discovery timelines and scale. In under two years, Recursion created hundreds of rare disease models and advanced a machine learning-discovered compound to Phase 1 clinical trials for cerebral cavernous malformation - among the first ML-discovered drugs to reach human testing. The company has set an ambitious goal to discover 100 clinical candidates in 10 years, which would represent orders of magnitude more than even the largest pharmaceutical companies currently achieve.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - TPU Image Processing (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Accelerated cellular microscopy image processing using TPUs
- **Evidence**: "Accelerates cellular microscopy image processing with TPUs"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: This describes technical infrastructure optimization, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: This is a Tier 1 efficiency improvement that should be excluded from transformation cases

**C2 - Training Time Reduction (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Reduced deep learning model training time from hours to minutes
- **Evidence**: "Reduces deep learning model training from hours to minutes with TensorFlow"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Training time reduction is operational efficiency, not strategic transformation
- **Recommendation**: This is a Tier 1 efficiency improvement that should be excluded from transformation cases

**C3 - 10x Development Speed (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Potential to cut drug discovery and development time by factor of 10
- **Evidence**: "potentially cutting the time to discover and develop a new medicine by a factor of 10"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Speculative claim without demonstrated results or specific timeline validation
- **Recommendation**: Find concrete evidence of achieved time reductions rather than potential claims

**C4 - Disease Model Creation (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Created hundreds of rare disease models in under two years
- **Evidence**: "In just under two years, Recursion has created hundreds of rare disease models and generated a shortlist of drug candidates across several diseases"
- **Source**: S1

**C5 - First ML Drug to Clinical Trials (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: First machine learning-discovered drug to reach clinical trials
- **Evidence**: "The candidate is among the first to make it to human testing that was found using machine learning"
- **Source**: S1

**C6 - Clinical Candidate Goal (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Goal to discover 100 clinical candidates in 10 years - orders of magnitude more than largest pharma companies
- **Evidence**: "Our goal is to discover 100 clinical candidates in the first 10 years of the company, which would be orders of magnitude more than even the largest pharmaceutical companies can achieve right now"
- **Source**: S1

**C7 - Computational Platform (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Platform supports computational bursts of trillions of calculations per second
- **Evidence**: "Its engineers have built a platform that supports bursts of computational power that weigh in at trillions of calculations per second"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Computational infrastructure capability is a technical enabler, not business model transformation
- **Recommendation**: This describes platform capacity, not strategic transformation evidence

**C8 - Clinical Safety Validation (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Lead experimental drug demonstrated safety in mid-stage trial
- **Evidence**: "Recursion Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday said results from a mid-stage trial showed its lead experimental drug to be safe"
- **Source**: S5

**C9 - Pipeline Readouts (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Combined pipeline expected to deliver around 10 clinical trial readouts over 18 months
- **Evidence**: "The companies touted the potential of their combined drug pipeline, which they expect to deliver around 10 clinical trial readouts over 18 months"
- **Source**: S5
