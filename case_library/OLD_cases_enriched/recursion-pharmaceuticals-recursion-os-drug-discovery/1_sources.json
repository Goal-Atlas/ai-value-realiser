      "content": "Recursion Pharmaceuticals:\nAI-enabled pipeline finds treatments for rare diseases\nAbout Recursion Pharmaceuticals\nFounded in 2013, Recursion Pharmaceuticals combines experimental biology, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence in a hybrid lab-to-cloud platform to identify treatments for any disease that can be modeled at the cellular level. Recursion's ultimate vision is building a map of human cellular biology to shift the pace and scale at which new treatments could benefit patients.\nTell us your challenge. We're here to help.\nContact usRecursion Pharmaceuticals is creating an AI-enabled human biology map to accelerate discovery of treatments for rare, untreated diseases.\nGoogle Cloud results\n- Accelerates cellular microscopy image processing with TPUs\n- Reduces deep learning model training from hours to minutes with TensorFlow\n- Integrates Recursion's local and cloud operations with Google Kubernetes Engine on-premises\nFirst drug to clinical trial found by machine learning\nAccelerating drug discovery\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is creating an AI-enabled map of human biology to accelerate discovering promising treatments for dozens of diseases with unmet medical need. The company, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, has built a drug discovery platform that combines chemistry, automated biology, and cloud computing tools to reveal new therapeutic candidates, potentially cutting the time to discover and develop a new medicine by a factor of 10.\nIt's a paradox, which observers call Eroom's Law: drug discovery, despite improvements in medical technology, has become increasingly slower and more expensive. As a result, the number of FDA-approved new medicines reaching patients has stagnated, while the costs of pharmaceutical R&D has continued to increase.\nThere are approximately 6,000 rare diseases affecting an estimated 25 million people \u2013 many of them young children \u2013 in the United States alone. The high cost and extremely long timelines of conventional drug development are even more daunting for rare diseases. As a result, less than 5 percent of rare diseases have FDA-approved treatments.\nRecursion is looking to address this paradox by combining a deep understanding of biology with the latest in machine learning tools to reimagine the drug discovery and development process. The company aims to use this approach to more rapidly and inexpensively discover new medicines for dozens of diseases, both rare and common.\nIn this quest, engineering, AI-pattern recognition, and cloud computing have proven as necessary as biochemical expertise in crafting the solution. Recursion's data pipeline incorporates image processing, inference engines, and deep learning modules. Its engineers have built a platform that supports bursts of computational power that weigh in at trillions of calculations per second.\nRecursion is already getting results. In just under two years, Recursion has created hundreds of rare disease models and generated a shortlist of drug candidates across several diseases, including moving a compound into Phase 1 clinical development towards treatment for cerebral cavernous malformation, a rare hereditary stroke syndrome. The candidate is among the first to make it to human testing that was found using machine learning. It typically takes at least 10 years to develop a new drug.\n\"Our goal is to discover 100 clinical candidates in the first 10 years of the company, which would be orders of magnitude more than even the largest pharmaceutical companies can achieve right now,\" says Recursion's Senior Vice President, Translational Discovery/Chief Evangelist, Ron Alfa.\nFrom wet biology to the cloud\nRecursion has integrated a massive processing pipeline and neural networks into a target platform that is scalable, cost-effective, and tracking to achieve potential treatments for both rare and common conditions in cardiology, neurology, dermatology, oncology, immunology, and ophthalmology, among others.\nIt starts with wet biology \u2013 plates of glass bottom wells containing thousands of healthy and diseased human cells. The firm's biologists run experiments on the cells, applying stains that help characterize and quantify the features of the cellular samples: their roundness, the thickness of their membrane, the shape of their mitochondria, and other characteristics.\nA microscopy team captures this data by snapping high-resolution photos of the cells at several different light wavelengths. A data pipeline that sits on top of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Confluent Kafka, all running on Google Cloud, extracts and analyzes cell features from the images. Mathematical models with data that represent the cell features are deployed in packages to GKE containers. Then, data are processed by deep neural networks to find patterns, including those humans might not recognize. The neural nets are trained to compare healthy and diseased tissue signatures with those of tissues before and after a variety of drug treatments."

      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- Recursion Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday said results from a mid-stage trial showed its lead experimental drug to be safe, the first readout in a series of important data disclosures for the AI drug discovery specialist.\n- But the summary findings Recursion announced provide little indication of whether the drug, a treatment for a potentially dangerous kind of vascular malformation in the brain, might be effective. MRI scans of the brains of study participants given the highest dose showed a \u201ctrend\u201d toward smaller lesions, Recursion said.\n- Shares in Recursion fell by double digits Tuesday morning. The Salt Lake City-based company intends to submit its data for publication in a scientific journal, and to discuss plans for a follow-up clinical trial with the Food and Drug Administration \u201cas soon as practical.\u201d\nDive Insight:\nThis year has been big for Recursion, which claims its vast datasets, and the technology it uses to mine them, will allow the company to \u201cturn drug discovery from sequential trial-and-error into a search problem.\u201d\nRecursion made a splash at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January, pitching its approach to biopharmaceutical industry executives at an event it co-hosted with chip giant Nvidia. Then, in August, Recursion announced a deal to combine with Exscientia, an AI drug discovery rival that had ranked among the field\u2019s most well resourced. The companies touted the potential of their combined drug pipeline, which they expect to deliver around 10 clinical trial readouts over 18 months.\nThursday\u2019s announcement involves a drug compound Recursion selected with earlier iterations of its technology and then licensed. Dubbed REC-994, the drug is designed to treat a neurovascular condition known as cerebral cavernous malformation. Typically sporadic in nature, the condition develops as irregular bunches of small blood vessels. Leaking blood from these formations can cause seizures, headaches and potentially fatal hemorrhagic stroke.\nWhile Recursion\u2019s trial was a Phase 2 test, its main goals centered on safety. The company said its drug met those goals. The frequency and severity of adverse events after one year of treatment were similar across the placebo, 200 milligram drug dose and 400 milligram drug dose groups.\nEfficacy evaluations were less clear. Along with the \u201ctrend\u201d toward reduced lesion size, Recursion also reported that treatment with REC-994 led to a similar trend on MRI scans in the size of hemosiderin rings \u2014 iron-containing halos caused by blood leaking from malformed vessels.\nNotably, an evaluation of patient- and physician-reported outcomes showed no improvement at the one-year mark.\nIn a statement provided by Recursion, Jan-Karl Burkhardt, the division head of cerebrovascular surgery at the University of Pennsylvania and the study\u2019s lead investigator, described the results as an \u201cimpressive start\u201d that \u201cstrongly supports the need for a future study.\u201d\nRecursion CEO Chris Gibson has made in recent remarks a point of emphasizing the company\u2019s overall pipeline, rather than talking up the importance of specific readouts.\n\u201cThere are going to be successes. There are going to be failures,\u201d he told reporters at the JPM meeting, speaking generally of AI drug discovery. \u201cPeople are going to make some predictions about the industry based on those early data points.\u201d\nStill, Tuesday\u2019s readout and those that follow this year and early next will likely do much to shape investors\u2019 views of whether Recursion\u2019s technology is more effective than more traditional approaches to drug discovery.\nData are expected this year from a candidate it\u2019s developing for neurofibromatosis type 2, and in the first half of 2025 for a treatment for familial adenomatous polyposis."
