# allpay Developer Productivity Case Study: GitHub Copilot Implementation

## Executive Summary

allpay, a UK-based payment services provider founded in 1994, implemented GitHub Copilot as part of a broader digital transformation and migration to Microsoft Azure. The company reported significant productivity improvements across their development teams, with overall developer productivity increasing by 10% and production delivery volume rising by 25%. The implementation particularly benefited junior developers and legacy code maintenance, while also improving code quality and reducing defect-related rework.

**Key Verified Outcomes:**
- 10% overall increase in developer productivity
- Up to 80% time savings in specific use cases
- Dramatic reduction in task completion times (stored procedures: 1 hour → 5 minutes; service setup: 1 week → 1 day)
- 25% increase in production delivery volume
- Nine-month release output exceeded previous full year total (>900 releases)

## Detailed Findings

### **APPROVED CLAIMS**

#### C1: Overall Developer Productivity Increase
**Claim:** Overall developer productivity increased by 10%  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** Direct quote from allpay's assessment: "allpay estimates that, overall, the team's use of GitHub Copilot has increased developer productivity by 10%."  
**Analysis:** This is a specific, quantified claim with clear attribution to GitHub Copilot usage.

#### C2: High-Impact Use Cases
**Claim:** Some use cases deliver up to 80% time savings  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "However, there are some use cases where the productivity boost is even higher—delivering as much as an 80% time saving."  
**Analysis:** Specific quantification of maximum productivity gains in optimal scenarios.

#### C3: Stored Procedures Creation Efficiency
**Claim:** Stored procedures creation time reduced from 1 hour to 5 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "I could have a set of stored procedures created now in five minutes, whereas it might have taken someone an hour to write stored procedures previously"  
**Analysis:** Concrete, measurable improvement with specific time comparisons (92% time reduction).

#### C4: Service Setup Time Reduction
**Claim:** Service setup time reduced from 1 week to 1 day  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "And we can have a depth of service set up in a day, rather than the week it took before."  
**Analysis:** Clear time comparison showing 86% reduction in service setup time.

#### C6: Release Volume Achievement
**Claim:** Nine-month releases exceeded previous full year total  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "In terms of releases out the door, in the nine months of this year to date, we have already delivered more than the 900 delivered in the whole of last year."  
**Analysis:** Specific, verifiable metric demonstrating significant output improvement.

#### C8: Production Release Increase Confirmation
**Claim:** 25% increase in production releases in nine months  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Evidence:** "a 25% increase in production releases in just nine months — surpassing its total output from the previous year"  
**Analysis:** Corroborates other release-related claims with specific quantification.

### **CLAIMS REQUIRING REVIEW**

#### C5: Production Delivery Volume Increase
**Claim:** Production delivery volume increased by 25%  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "In combination with some organisational changes, the adoption of GitHub Copilot has driven up delivery volume into production by 25%."  
**Issue:** Attribution unclear - improvement credited to both GitHub Copilot AND organizational changes.

#### C7: Coding Productivity Boost
**Claim:** 10% boost in coding productivity confirmed  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "After adopting an AI coding assistant and migrating its systems to the cloud through Microsoft Azure, the FinTech provider saw a 10% boost in coding productivity"  
**Issue:** Improvement attributed to both AI assistant AND cloud migration, making specific GitHub Copilot impact unclear.

#### C9: Reduced Rework and Defect Fixing
**Claim:** Reduced time spent on rework and defect fixing  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "The amount of time we are spending on rework and defect fixing has dropped"  
**Issue:** Qualitative claim without quantification or specific metrics.

#### C10: Incident Reduction
**Claim:** Fewer incidents occurring  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "We're getting fewer incidents."  
**Issue:** Vague claim lacking quantification or baseline comparison.

#### C11: Code Quality Improvement
**Claim:** Improved code quality through standardization  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW  
**Evidence:** "GitHub Copilot frees up time for frequent code reviews, ensuring standardization and significantly improving code quality"  
**Issue:** Qualitative improvement claim without specific metrics or measurable outcomes.
