# General Mills AI Supply Chain Optimization Case File

## Executive Summary

General Mills has successfully implemented AI-driven supply chain optimization initiatives that have generated significant measurable returns. The food industry giant has achieved over $20 million in cost savings through AI models that assess more than 5,000 daily shipments from plants to warehouses since fiscal year 2024. The company projects an additional $50 million in waste reduction through real-time manufacturing performance data analysis.

These AI implementations are part of General Mills' broader "Accelerate" strategy launched five years ago, which has seen the company double its digital, data, and technology investments since 2019. The AI applications have specifically targeted logistics planning, transportation cost reduction, and customer service level improvements, with CFO Kofi Bruce highlighting the logistics planning benefits during an investor conference.

This case demonstrates concrete ROI from enterprise AI implementation in supply chain management, providing specific financial metrics and operational improvements that can be verified through public company disclosures.
