# City of Helsinki: Virtual Assistants for Citizen Support

## Executive Summary

The City of Helsinki has embarked on an ambitious digital transformation initiative aimed at becoming "the most functional digital city on the planet" through the implementation of proactive digital services. Central to this effort is the adoption of MyData principles, which prioritize citizen control over personal data while enabling advanced analytics-driven services. The city is transitioning from reactive digital services to proactive ones that can automatically contact citizens when needed, with a particular focus on healthcare applications where data analytics can identify high-risk patients and enable preventive interventions. This approach emphasizes transparency, citizen consent, and mutual benefits for both residents and the city administration.
