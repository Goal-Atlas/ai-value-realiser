# Case File: Rolls-Royce's Real-time Engine Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance

## Executive Summary

Rolls-Royce has implemented comprehensive real-time engine monitoring and predictive maintenance capabilities through their IntelligentEngine technology and service programs like TotalCare and CorporateCare. The company leverages automated data pipelines and digital twin technology to optimize maintenance operations, improve aircraft availability, and reduce operational disruptions.

The implementation demonstrates significant operational improvements, with over 97% of missed trips averted and average Aircraft on Ground (AOG) response resolution times reduced to under 24 hours. The CorporateCare program has achieved strong market adoption, covering almost 1,900 aircraft globally with over 70% of new Rolls-Royce powered aircraft deliveries enrolled in the program.

These AI-driven capabilities enable Rolls-Royce to transfer maintenance risk from aircraft owners to the OEM while providing predictable maintenance costs, reduced capital investment requirements, and increased aircraft residual value for operators.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Data Collection Automation (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Automated data pipeline reduces time to collect data and improves data accuracy
- **Evidence**: "With the knowledge that they shared airline customers, Rolls-Royce approached IFS to help automate this data flow, which could cut down the time to collect data and improve data accuracy."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Vague metrics without specific quantification of time reduction or accuracy improvement
- **Recommendation**: Find specific metrics on data collection time reduction and accuracy improvement percentages

**C2 - Enhanced Predictive Maintenance (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Real-time data enables more robust predictive maintenance offerings with multiple data points
- **Evidence**: "When you start having multiple variables going in and coming out, it means that Rolls-Royce's offering can be more robust. They have more data points, and they have the ability to automate the output that they generate"
- **Source**: S2

**C3 - Engine Availability Optimization (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: IntelligentEngine maximizes engine availability while minimizing maintenance costs and disruption
- **Evidence**: "Furthermore, the engine comprehends all of this information in a way that can support making smart decisions to maximize engine availability while minimizing maintenance costs and disruption."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Aspirational claims without specific metrics on availability improvement or cost reduction
- **Recommendation**: Find quantified data on availability percentages and maintenance cost reductions

**C4 - TotalCare Service Improvements (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: TotalCare delivers more availability, less disruption, and fewer maintenance interventions
- **Evidence**: "But above all, it's about creating a step-by-step change in the delivery of TotalCare to airline operators. This means more availability, less disruption, and fewer maintenance interventions."
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Directional claims without specific quantification of improvements
- **Recommendation**: Find specific metrics on availability percentages, disruption reduction, and maintenance intervention frequency

**C5 - Financial Benefits (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: CorporateCare provides predictable maintenance costs, reduced capital investment and increased aircraft residual value
- **Evidence**: "it also provides operators with significant financial benefits, including predictable maintenance costs, reduced capital investment and, perhaps most importantly, increased aircraft residual value."
- **Source**: S5
- **Issue**: No quantified metrics for the financial benefits claimed
- **Recommendation**: Find specific data on cost predictability, capital investment reduction percentages, and residual value increases

**C6 - Operational Performance Metrics (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Improved operational availability with over 97% averted missed trips and under 24-hour AOG response resolution time
- **Evidence**: "We already see the benefit of this service as we have significantly improved averted missed trips to over 97 percent, while our average AOG response resolution time is now under 24 hours"
- **Source**: S5

**C7 - Risk Transfer Model (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: CorporateCare transfers maintenance risk from owner to OEM with immediate tax benefits
- **Evidence**: "Being the only programme for Rolls-Royce powered aircraft that fully transfers the risk of engine maintenance from the owner to the OEM – which also entails immediate tax benefits"
- **Source**: S5

**C8 - Market Adoption Success (APPROVED)**
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Claim**: Strong market adoption with almost 1,900 aircraft covered and over 70% of new deliveries enrolled
- **Evidence**: "Almost 1,900 aircraft around the world are now covered by CorporateCare and more than 70 percent of new delivery Rolls-Royce powered aircraft are enrolled in the programme."
