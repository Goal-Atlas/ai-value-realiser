      "content": "Self-driving cars are slowly becoming less sci-fi and more real-world as companies like Waymo, the autonomous arm of Google's parent, Alphabet, expand into more areas. On Wednesday, Waymo said it's driving in four new cities: Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Philadelphia.\nWaymo is starting with manual driving in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis before eventually switching to autonomous operations. In Philadelphia, it's now operating autonomously with a human specialist monitoring behind the wheel. This comes after Waymo said in July that it was bringing a limited fleet of its vehicles to \"the most complex parts\" of the city, \"including downtown and freeways.\"\nWaymo currently offers fully autonomous rides to the general public in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas, through the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace. The vehicles can be summoned either via the Waymo app or Uber, depending on the city. In November, Waymo began driving passengers on freeways in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.\nThe self-driving company has added several new cities to its roster in recent months. In an Aug. 29 blog post, Waymo noted it's \"entering a new chapter and accelerating our commercial expansion.\" You can find a full list of where Waymo currently operates and plans to expand below.\nWaymo's growth extends to its manufacturing facilities. In May, the company said it's opening a new, 239,000-square-foot autonomous vehicle factory in the Phoenix area. The plan is to add 2,000 more fully autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to its existing 1,500-vehicle fleet. Notably, Waymo indicated it received its \"final delivery from Jaguar\" earlier this year, as it plans for future iterations of its driverless rides. Waymo added that the \"facility's flexible design\" will allow it to integrate its upcoming sixth-generation self-driving technology into new vehicles, starting with the all-electric Zeekr RT.\nLast October, Waymo also announced it's partnering with Hyundai to bring the next generation of its technology into Ioniq 5 SUVs. In the years to come, riders will be able to summon those all-electric, autonomous vehicles using the Waymo app. And in April, Waymo said it reached a preliminary agreement with Toyota to \"explore a collaboration\" geared toward developing autonomous driving tech, which could someday be factored into personally owned vehicles.\nThe self-driving company says it's driven over 100 million fully autonomous miles on public roads and has provided more than 10 million paid rides. I've hailed several rides myself in San Francisco, and as off-putting as it can seem at first (especially to see a steering wheel turn by itself), I quickly adjusted, and it soon felt like an ordinary ride.\nThat's not to say there hasn't been pushback as Waymo rolls out to more cities. The company's vehicles have been involved in a handful of high-profile collisions, including one with a bicyclist in San Francisco and another with a towed pickup truck in Phoenix. (Waymo recalled and updated its software to address the issue.)\nWaymo's Safety Impact report notes that over the course of 71 million autonomous miles driven through March 2025, its Waymo Driver technology had 88% fewer crashes leading to serious injuries or worse and 78% fewer injury-causing crashes, compared with \"an average human driver over the same distance in our operating cities.\" It also reported significantly fewer crashes with injuries to pedestrians (93%), cyclists (81%) and motorcyclists (86%).\nAs Waymo continues to expand and develop its self-driving tech, here's how and where to summon the robotaxi if you happen to be in one of the few cities where the company currently operates its fleet.\nHailing a ride in Phoenix\nPhoenix was the first city to open up fully autonomous Waymo rides to the public, in 2020. To hail a ride, download the Waymo app on iOS or Android. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nYou can also use the Uber app to summon one of Waymo's vehicles in Phoenix. When you request an UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric ride, you'll have the choice to confirm a Waymo ride, if you're matched.\nIn addition to hailing a ride, you may also have your Uber Eats meal delivered by an autonomous car. When placing an order in the Phoenix area, you might get a note that \"autonomous vehicles may deliver your order.\" When the Waymo car arrives, take your phone with you to pop open the trunk and grab your delivery. You can opt out of this during checkout if you'd rather have a human deliver your food.\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport became the first major airport to offer fully autonomous Waymo rides to its terminals. Waymo said in September 2025 that it has \"served hundreds of thousands of trips to/from Sky Harbor, and it remains the single most popular Waymo destination in Phoenix.\"\nWaymo added freeways access to passengers in Phoenix in November.\nHailing a ride in the San Francisco Bay Area\nSan Francis"

      "content": "Waymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages \u201cmore decisively,\u201d the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend.\nWaymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treats dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.\nInstead, many of the vehicles requested a \u201cconfirmation check\u201d from Waymo\u2019s fleet response team to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a \u201cconcentrated spike\u201d in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.\nWaymo said it built this confirmation request system \u201cout of an abundance of caution during our early deployment\u201d but that it is now refining it to \u201cmatch our current scale.\u201d\n\u201cWhile this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,\u201d the company wrote.\nThe software update will add \u201ceven more context about regional outages\u201d to the company\u2019s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by \u201cincorporating lessons from this event.\u201d\nWhile a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo\u2019s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles \u201csuccessfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.\u201d\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

      "content": "Waymo, the frontrunner in the self-driving car industry, today announces the moment everyone has been waiting for: It is officially \u201claunching\u201d a robo-taxi service in Chandler, Arizona, wherein riders will use an app to hail the vehicles to take them anywhere in an 80 to 100 square mile area, for a price.\n\u201cToday, we're taking the next step in our journey with the introduction of our commercial self-driving service, Waymo One,\u201d Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote in a blog post.\nThe banner Waymo is unfurling, though, is tattered by caveats. Waymo One will only be available to the 400 or so people already enrolled in Waymo\u2019s early rider program, which has been running in the calm, sunny Phoenix suburb of Chandler for about 18 months. (They can bring guests with them and have been freed from non-disclosure agreements that kept them from publicly discussing their experiences.) More glaringly, the cars will have a human behind the wheel, there to take control in case the car does something it shouldn\u2019t.\nSo no, this is not the anyone-can-ride, let-the-robot-drive experience Waymo and its competitors have been promising for years. Building a reliably safe system has proven far harder than just about everyone anticipated and its cars aren\u2019t ready to drive without human oversight. But Waymo promised to launch a commercial service sometime in 2018, it didn\u2019t want to miss its deadline and risk its reputation as the leader of the industry it essentially created, and not even the might of Waymo parent company Alphabet can delay the end of the calendar year.\nSo Waymo is pushing out a software update, tweaking its branding, and calling it a launch.\nIt\u2019s a letdown, yes, but we get it: This is perhaps the hardest technological challenge of the modern era. And even those who understand it best seem to have underestimated its gnarliness. Just a year ago, Krafcik crowed that Waymo was taking the safety operators out of its cars. \u201cFully self-driving cars are here,\u201d he said onstage at the Web Summit in Lisbon. And from there, he promised, adding in paying passengers would be an easy move. \u201cThe difference between those two things is relatively slight,\u201d Krafcik told reporters. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got a fully driverless car interacting with the world, all of the other human-driven cars, pedestrians and cyclists and other things that are on the road at the same time.\u201d\nThe drivers are still here. The bravado is gone. And the true timeline toward true driverlessness is becoming apparent. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking towards a time when a car comes and picks you up and there\u2019s no one in it and it\u2019s truly your space,\u201d says Waymo spokesperson Liz Markman. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a gradual path to get there.\u201d\nThe path is gradual because for all our flaws, humans are great at driving, at least when we pay attention. And for all their talents, robots are terrible at it. A human driver\u2019s skills scale and adapt well to just about any situation: Make a left there, and you can make it anywhere. Robots\u2019 skills are more context-specific, what roboticists call brittle. Even in placid, boring Chandler, Waymo\u2019s cars encounter an endless variety of situations involving pedestrians, cyclists, scooter-ers, and other drivers. \u201cHumans adapt incredibly well to those scenarios,\u201d says Matt Johnson-Roberson, who co-directs the University of Michigan Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles. \u201cCars do not.\u201d\nAnd the risk of failure is far more serious than a 404 page or a frustrated user. As Uber proved in March and human drivers prove every day, mistakes on the road can be deadly. So until Waymo or any other developer is really, truly sure their system is safe, the human overseer will stay put. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a reflection of our iterative and incremental approach,\u201d says Waymo product chief Dan Chu.\nAnd self-driving systems are so intricate and elaborate that updating the software is more like tweaking a personality than fixing a set of bugs. You might address merging onto the highway by tuning the car to be a bit more aggressive, only to find that behavior creates unwanted results elsewhere on the road, says Johnson-Roberson. \u201cWith these highly complex systems, it is unclear what one change will do.\u201d\nIn the decade since it started out as Google\u2019s self-driving car project, Waymo has made astounding progress. Its cars have driven 10 million miles on public roads in 25 US cities, and another 10 billion in simulation. Chandler locals say they drive well, if too conservatively. The company has helped shape legislation governing the technology, tackled the knotty problem of keeping a fleet of cars in good shape and on the road, and it has built a dispatch system that connects riders and rides.\nBut Waymo hasn\u2019t reached a point where it\u2019s confident in its cars\u2019 ability to stay safe without human oversight. And it\u2019s not sure when it will get there. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely under no illusions about the path ahead of us,\u201d Chu says. \u201cI think anyone who says otherwise doesn\u2019t understand the challeng"
