# Case File: Waymo's Commercial Autonomous Robotaxi Service

## Executive Summary

Waymo has achieved significant commercial scale in autonomous vehicle operations, representing a fundamental transformation in transportation services. The company has driven over 100 million fully autonomous miles on public roads and provided more than 10 million paid rides, demonstrating the viability of AI-powered robotaxi services as a new market category.

The company's safety performance shows 88% fewer crashes leading to serious injuries compared to human drivers over 71 million autonomous miles, providing the regulatory and consumer confidence necessary for commercial expansion. Waymo currently operates fully autonomous rides in five major cities and is rapidly scaling manufacturing capacity with plans to add 2,000 vehicles to its existing 1,500-vehicle fleet through a new 239,000-square-foot factory.

Waymo's integration with major infrastructure like Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, where it has served hundreds of thousands of trips, demonstrates the commercial viability and premium market penetration of autonomous transportation services. This represents a clear transformation where AI autonomy is the core product, creating an entirely new business model that wouldn't exist without the underlying AI technology.
