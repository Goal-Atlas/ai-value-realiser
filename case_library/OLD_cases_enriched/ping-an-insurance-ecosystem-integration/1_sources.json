      "content": "How Ping An Insurance Embraced Digital To Rewrite Its Business\nAs my colleague Ted Schadler stated (and I agree), digital transformation is in a sorry state. The term \u201cdigital transformation\u201d has been constantly mentioned over the past few years, even becoming some enterprises\u2019 North Star. But digital transformation can be a puzzle for business and technology leaders.\nWhen my colleague Meng Liu and I attended Ping An\u2019s cloud summit last October, we found that Ping An has set such a good example for enterprises\u2019 digital transformation that we decided to write a case study on it. As a leading traditional insurer, Ping An started its transformation journey by aiming to create a customer-obsessed culture and an AI-powered end-to-end offering. It has achieved remarkable results: increasing revenue by almost 250% and nearly tripling revenue between 2013 and 2017. During its digital transformation, Ping An employed three approaches:\n- Creating efficient, relevant, and unified customer experiences. A customer-obsessed culture is one of the two key themes Ping An had when it started the transformation. The insurer has worked continuously to improve its claim settlement efficiency. Ping An Property & Casualty debuted its 510 Ultra-Speed On-Site City Inspection and One-Click Arrangement services, which enable insurance agents to reach an accident scene in 5 to 10 minutes for 95% of claims. Ping An also learned a lesson from China\u2019s internet giants: Offer something free to acquire users and then convert them to customers who actually buy products. And as a firm with many products and services, Ping An launched a \u201cmagic gate\u201d portal to let customers access products and services from different departments and subsidiaries, saving them the trouble of jumping from app to app. Ping An now boasts more than 510 million internet customers and 180 million retail finance customers.\n- Achieving operational excellence with homegrown digital tech. An AI-powered end-to-end offering is the other key to Ping An\u2019s digital transformation. In the past decade, Ping An has invested US$7 billion in R&D for AI, cloud computing, and blockchain and now expects to invest a further $15 billion in the coming 10 years. The firm now has seven research institutes, 25 research labs, and more than 24,000 R&D staff members, 1,000 of whom focus on emerging tech. It has invested in facial, voiceprint, and microexpression biometrics and deployed natural language processing and speech analytics. All of these technological capabilities allow Ping An to automate processes to improve business value and CX and give employees digital capabilities. The firm now uses Ping An Cloud, formerly its internal cloud platform, to increase application security and agility and serve thousands of customers in the finance and healthcare industries.\n- Continuously innovating beyond existing business ecosystems. To provide better services and reach more customers, Ping An redirected customer journeys from its traditional insurance, banking, and asset management services to a broad range of lifestyle needs such as autos, housing, and health. OneConnect, Ping An\u2019s fintech software-as-a-service, is now the world\u2019s largest cloud platform for banking, insurance, and investment solutions, serving hundreds of banks. Ping An subsidiary Lufax, an online marketplace for originating and trading financial assets, is now a top-10 fintech player globally and China\u2019s top peer-to-peer lender. Ping An\u2019s Good Doctor provides healthcare services from online consultations (500,000 per day) to medicine order and delivery, linking 228 million users and 3,100 hospitals. To build an automobile ecosystem, Ping An acquired Autohome, now the largest online car-buying platform in China, which helped Ping An Bank become the leader in auto finance and Ping An Property & Casualty become the second-largest auto insurer in China by volume.\nThe story of Ping An\u2019s transformation story is truly impressive.

      "content": "IMD Case Study: Ping An's Rise as a Technology Giant Yields Key Business Lessons\nHONG KONG and SHANGHAI, Nov. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (hereafter \"Ping An\" or the \"Group\", HKEX: 02318; SSE: 601318) is the subject of a case study published today by the International Institute of Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland for the Group's transformation from a traditional insurer to a technology disrupter.\n\"In the Field with Ping An\" by Professor Howard Yu and Research Associate Yunfei Feng, traces the evolution of Ping An from a property and casualty insurance company to a \"tech giant\" that now includes 11 technology companies and an ecosystem strategy that includes financial services, health care, auto and smart cities.\n\"Ping An Chairman Peter Ma had the foresight to invest in technology early,\" said Prof. Yu, the LEGO\u00ae Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD. \"He saw, before the rest of the traditional financial services industry, that the internet economy was affecting every aspect of people's lives and he seized the opportunity. Mr. Ma led Ping An to invest aggressively in cloud computing back in 2013, when it was still considered a fringe phenomenon, but the cloud allowed Ping An to develop advanced data analytics, which was an essential step to become the technology-driven company it is now.\"\nPing An is now the most valuable insurance group worldwide and ranks seventh in the Forbes Global 2000. The case study notes that its share price has surged by more than 400% between 2013 and 2019.\nThe case study highlighted five key lessons from Ping An:\n- Harness technology capabilities - Ping An invests 1% of its annual revenue in technology research and development which enables it to stay ahead of competitors.\n- Scale up innovation and connect with new partners - Ping An develops proprietary technology, then repackages solutions to sell in the marketplace. For example, OneConnect, its technology-as-a-service associate company, serves financial institutions.\n- Diversify your management team - Ping An has an international leadership team, which includes many people with backgrounds outside traditional financial services. This diversity helped to drive exploration of different business models.\n- Change the mindset - Look beyond short-term planning and guaranteed immediate returns to take risks on longer-term investments.\n- Kill the \"not invented here\" syndrome - Ping An brought in outside capital, reducing capital constraints and lowering the investment risk for Ping An. This allows a longer payback period for its start-ups.\nPing An's strategy has been tested by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the diversity of its revenue streams have proven to be a significant advantage. For example, OneConnect added more than 50 new customers including banks and insurance companies that needed smart customer services, and during the peak of the epidemic, Ping An Good Doctor, the largest health care platform in China, was accessed over 1.11 billion times.\nThe businesses in the Ping An Group have also generated synergies on multiple fronts. For example, Autohome, an online car buying platform, offers relevant financial services, distributing 3,000 credit cards a day. The ecosystems create opportunities to attract clients from one business to another and to cross-sell: in 2019, 74 million customers had contracts with more than one Ping An company.\nDownload In the Field with Ping An\nAbout Ping An Group\nPing An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (\"Ping An\") is a world-leading technology-powered retail financial services group.

      "content": "Insurers must consider participating in ecosystems to disrupt, instead of being disrupted.\nHighlights\n- Accenture analyzed 18 industries and found that although insurance is currently experiencing a moderate level of disruption, it is among those most susceptible to future disruption.\n- It has been estimated that by 2022, carriers that are slow to respond to changes by agile, hyper-relevant competitors\u2014we call them \u2018living businesses\u2019\u2014could suffer market share erosion worth a total of US$198 billion worldwide over the next five years. They would also forfeit the opportunity to pursue new growth opportunities worth $177 billion.\n- Ecosystems are a major cause of this wave of industry disruption. Rather than becoming victims of it, insurance companies can join existing ecosystems or design and execute their own to ensure they are the disruptors, rather than the disrupted.\nQuestions answered in this ultimate guide\n- Why is the insurance industry vulnerable to disruption?\n- Are new technologies a threat or an opportunity?\n- How are insurtech companies disrupting the insurance playing field?\n- How can insurers and insurtechs work harmoniously together?\n- What is an ecosystem?\n- What is the difference between a partnership and an ecosystem?\n- How are ecosystems disrupting the insurance industry?\n- If ecosystems are a major source of industry disruption, what are insurers waiting for?\n- What can insurers bring to the table in an ecosystem?\n- When it comes to ecosystems, where do insurers fall short?\n- What questions should I ask when defining my ecosystem?\n- How can my business be an attractive ecosystem partner?\n- What makes an ecosystem master?\n- How can insurers select the right ecosystem partner?\n- What underpins a successful ecosystem?\n- How can insurers play to win in the ecosystem?\n- How can I practically integrate the customer in my ecosystem?\n- What role does blockchain play within ecosystems?\n- How can blockchain deliver new efficiencies for insurers?\n- How can insurers use Accenture\u2019s \u2018wise pivot\u2019 to benefit from ecosystems?\n- Case study: the wise pivot in action.\nWhy is the insurance industry vulnerable to disruption?\nAccenture\u2019s analysis of 18 industries shows that the insurance industry is highly susceptible to future disruption. In 2013, when the first Disruptability Index study was conducted, insurance was experiencing a low level of disruption but ranked fourth in its susceptibility to future disruption. Today, as foreseen, the level of disruption has risen significantly. And this is just the beginning: the industry\u2019s susceptibility has also escalated.\nWhy now? The insurance industry has one of the highest ratios of cost of labor to final price, meaning that there is a great deal of trapped value inside the insurance value chain.\nSince 2013, Accenture research has predicted that every business, in insurance as well as elsewhere, will need to become a digital business. In an increasingly connected world, consumers manage most of their lives online. This means that their assets are online and they are accustomed to receiving online experiences tailored to them. They are going to expect that you know who they are, what they need and when they need it. They will set high standards for your service levels, and will demand that you are easy to transact with. Added to this is the fact that the nature of risk is changing, as is the way carriers tailor and serve insurance experiences for their customers.\nThe world is going to keep changing, and the model that insurers have executed for the past 20 years will probably not be the model that they are going to execute in the next 20 years. Disruption is likely to accelerate and intensify. Insurance executives, therefore, cannot afford to be complacent.\nAre new technologies a threat or an opportunity?\nNew technologies, from artificial intelligence to big data, are set to transform the insurance industry. This is no surprise, because the nature of insurance is data-, IT- and intelligence-intensive. The most fascinating (and potentially disruptive) developments lie at the intersection of new technologies, where they combine to offer new, integrated and diverse value propositions. This is illustrated clearly by the gray ellipse in the diagram below.\nThis is exciting for consumers, because it introduces the possibility of an end-to-end insurance proposition that covers everything from risk protection to risk advice and prevention, and a broader range of services. Then, there is the trend of insurtech companies plugging into existing insurance infrastructures, leveraging traditional carriers\u2019 customer bases and data sets while offering them attractive new business efficiencies in the process. Insurance companies, old and new, are forging ecosystems in order to weather the potential disruption of the current and future market.\nIf insurers don\u2019t innovate and embrace new technologies and ways of partnering with other stakeholders, these new technologies, in all their i"

These are:\nFor a better understanding of the ecosystem, we\u2019ll discuss some noteworthy examples.\nThree InsurTech Ecosystem Examples\nEcosystems help introduce business models like API-based insurance and microservices. They\u2019re also vital to helping consumers get personalized insurance services. Let\u2019s discuss three ecosystems in this niche:\n1. Ping An Insurance\nPing An Insurance of China is an ideal example of an InsurTech ecosystem. Through Innovation, it sells insurance services, and also provides other ads-on like Good Doctor, a care service.\nAnother service it offers is Pinganfang, a real estate service, and AutoHome which organizes recreational activities.\n2. BNP Paribas Cardif\nCardif Insurance is another typical example of an InsurTech ecosystem. The company works primarily in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, to provide insurance services.\nBeyond insurance, they also offer other financial services like real estate credit, personal investment, and other consumer-friendly services.\n3. Discovery\nA South African insurer named Discovery Insurance offers its consumers an ecosystem that entails life, car, and home coverage, together with medical aid and other financial services.\nBy creating an ecosystem, discovery noted that its consumer base has gained significantly. For example, its health and wellness program users have 28% fewer hospital stays.\nThis improved its profit margin. This shows that ecosystems are beneficial to insurance businesses.\nLet\u2019s discuss more the benefits of the insurance ecosystem.\nOpportunities Created by the Insurance Ecosystem\nThe InsurTech ecosystem opens up a number of opportunities for every business to help make your InsurTech idea stand out. Below are some benefits:\n1. Unlimited Startup Scaling Potential\nThe InsurTech market is expected to be worth 114 billion by 2030 as it\u2019s currently growing at 46.1% between 2022 and 2030. This shows that the growth potential is strong, and startups can benefit from this by plugging themselves into or creating an ecosystem.\nOne startup benefiting from this opportunity is Alipay Insurance. The Insurtech service usage gained over 5 million new users the month it launched the Alipay super app.\n2. Introduction of New Products\nOne great benefit of InsurTech ecosystems is that they help to introduce new brands of products to an existing customer base. For example, Lemonade Insurance currently helps Uber with its product users\u2019 rental insurance.\nThis provides Lemonade with a straightforward market for Uber\u2019s 131 million app users.\n3. Creation of New Revenue Streams\nEcosystems help to create new profit streams. A study conducted by Sopheon shows that adding more services to an ecosystem adds to your revenue.\nFor example, Curacel, an AI-powered system for claims processing was able to seamlessly introduce its embedded insurance service to consumers within its ecosystem. Through this, it has been able to raise its revenue by 20%.\n4. Cross-Application Data Exchange\nCross-application data exchange, the transfer of information between platforms within the same ecosystem plays a pivotal role for insurance companies, especially for Insurance companies leveraging generative AI.\nSince ecosystems have multiple platforms that are accessed via a single one, the host determines what data is shared.\nThis ensures that all products get the needed data to guarantee personalized features.\nFor example, information from the Uber app is exchanged with Lemonade insurance, as they work together.\nAnother example is Lyft. It shares data with GrubHub, the insurance service in its ecosystem. This enables Grubhub users to get personalized insurance services.\nLet\u2019s discuss ways this can benefit your startup.\nHow to Leverage the Ecosystem Approach to "
