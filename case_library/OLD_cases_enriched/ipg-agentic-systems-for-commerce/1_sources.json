      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- Interpublic Group (IPG) has launched a new artificial intelligence-powered unit designed to help brands manage and understand how their products are faring in the increasingly complex commerce ecosystem, per a news release.\n- The new Agentic Systems for Commerce (ASC) uses data to generate insights about products, competitors and consumer behavior, including product searches, digital shelf position, pricing and inventory. ACS is being piloted by more than 20 brands, with results that have shown double-digit sales improvement, according to IPG.\n- IPG, which is currently set to be acquired by Omnicom in the second half of this year, reported revenue declines of 6.6% and 7.6% during its second-quarter and first-half results, respectively.\nDive Insight:\nAgentic AI has been getting a lot of attention across industries for its potential to understand and contextualize the information coming out of generative AI chat bots. IPG\u2019s launch of Agentic Systems for Commerce (ASC) demonstrates the holding company\u2019s commitment to leveraging automation and AI to develop solutions for its clients and new business opportunities.\nThe new unit marks a \u201cfoundational shift for sales and marketing teams to move from standalone tools to intelligent systems,\u201d enabling brands to be less reactive with more unified strategy and performance across the entire e-commerce system, IPG noted in press details.\nAt a time when the ad holding group\u2019s revenue is declining, such agentic AI-powered tools could be a value-add amid IPG\u2019s revenue struggles.\n\u201cWe believe products like ASC can become a new revenue stream for us. And it's another way in which we can use AI to scale our expertise and expand our business beyond our core capability set of marketing communications and media into solutions sets that deliver quantifiable results,\u201d said IPG CEO Philippe Krakowsky in a release.\nKrakowsky also recently indicated that AI is an area where there are potential synergies to be realized should the proposed merger with Omnicom go through later this year as scheduled.\n\u201cAs we expected, we're finding that our respective capabilities in areas such as platforms, data, commerce and AI development are highly complementary,\u201d Krakowsky said during the company\u2019s recent earnings call. \u201cAnd this gives us a high degree of confidence that the combined assets will be extremely powerful and differentiated in the marketplace. As [Omnicom CEO John Wren] and I have also noted previously, the capacity that the new Omnicom will have to continue to invest and build out on its leadership position in the tech and AI space will be considerable and will further differentiate these offerings over time.\u201d\nASC will be led by Dr. Jeriad Zoghby, IPG\u2019s chief commerce strategy officer, who joined the company from Accenture in 2023. The initiative was backed by IPG\u2019s Global Head of AI commerce Yaniv Sarig, who was part of the company\u2019s acquisition of Intelligence Node for a reported $100 million last December. ASC uses data from Intelligence Node to generate insights across digital commerce channels."

      "content": "New York, NY, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) today announced the launch of Agentic Systems for Commerce (ASC), a new offering designed to help brands manage the scaled and complex commerce ecosystem in ways that are not possible without automation and artificial intelligence. To optimize commerce performance, ASC leverages Interpublic\u2019s proprietary agentic system and is powered by data from Intelligence Node, the transaction data company Interpublic acquired earlier this year.\nASC captures data signals for every product and its competitors, including at the SKU and store level, generating actionable intelligence from insights into consumer searches, digital shelf position, product page content, pricing, and inventory levels, and enabling brands to optimize sales and margin performance across digital commerce channels. The new offering will be led by Dr. Jeriad Zoghby, Chief Commerce Strategy Officer at Interpublic, who joined IPG from Accenture in 2023 and has deep experience with the design and integration of large-scale enterprise systems across a variety of sectors.\nASC is already being piloted by almost two dozen brands with results to date that have shown double-digit improvements in impressions and sales.\n\"Agentic Systems for Commerce can help brands compete and succeed in an evolving and demanding marketplace and flatten the cost curve associated with the complex commerce landscape,\" said Philippe Krakowsky, CEO at Interpublic. \"We believe ASC can become a new revenue stream for us, and it\u2019s another way in which we can use AI to scale our expertise and expand our business beyond our core capabilities of marketing communications and media, into solution sets that deliver quantifiable results.\u201d\n\"We're seeing strong early momentum with ASC,\" said Dr. Zoghby. \"Over 20 CPG brands have already deployed our agentic commerce system. This quick adoption demonstrates our clients' recognition that today's commerce environment demands more than tools, even AI-enabled ones. They need integrated agentic systems that autonomously capture market-wide signals, identify performance opportunities, and execute in real time, enabling brands to move with the speed, precision, and enterprise agility this new era demands.\"\nTo support initiatives such as this one, earlier this year Interpublic appointed Yaniv Sarig as the Global Head of AI Commerce and completed the strategic acquisition of Intelligence Node, whose market-wide, real-time signal capabilities power the commerce intelligence and activation at the core of the offering.\nASC marks a foundational shift for sales and marketing teams from standalone tools to intelligent systems, allowing brands to move from reactive to adaptive operations, with unified, financially aligned performance across the entire commerce ecosystem.\n# # #\nAbout Interpublic\nInterpublic (NYSE: IPG) (www.interpublic.com) is a values-based, data-fueled, and creatively-driven provider of marketing solutions. Home to some of the world\u2019s best-known and most innovative communications specialists, IPG global brands include Acxiom, Craft, FCB, FutureBrand, Golin, Initiative, IPG Health, IPG Mediabrands, Jack Morton, KINESSO, MAGNA, McCann, Mediahub, Momentum, MRM, MullenLowe Global, Octagon, UM, Weber Shandwick and more.

      "content": "It has long been known that the hyper-fragmentation of consumer\nbrands -- especially rapidly emerging challenger brands enabled by digital commerce platforms -- have been eating the lunch of long-established brands in many categories, but now a new, empirical\nstudy from IPG's Agentic Systems in Commerce unit provides concrete evidence that legacy CPG brands need to take notice of.\nThe just-released report, \"The Hidden Economy Taking Share from Big Brands,\" is derived from the unit's proprietary\nanalysis of data from Amazon's marketplace, showing shocking deltas -- as much as 86 percentage points in the health care category -- in terms of the sales win rates between legacy and emerging\nchallenger brands.\nIn fact, the report finds the challenger brands are winning in 16 of the 18 categories analyzed and are already dominant in 15 of them (with category win rates greater\nthan 15%).\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nThe report makes it clear that there no longer is a barrier to entry in many traditional CPG categories, and advises that legacy brands take a cue from the emerging ones by\n\"operating at machine speed.\"\n\"Major CPG brands face an unavoidable handicap,\" the report notes, adding: \"Unlike insurgent brands, they must compete across dozens of retailers, with thousands\nof SKUs per retailer and millions of digital shelf placements, each governed by different algorithms.\"\nThe result? Up to 90% of legacy brand product pages go untouched for many months, or even\nyears.\nAs large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and answer engines \"become a primary way consumers discover products, the brands that update content continuously will shape the information\nthese systems rely on,\" the report advises."
