# Accenture: Reduced IT Demand Through Citizen Development Platform

## Executive Summary

Accenture partnered with Blueriq to transform their business process automation platform by building scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS. This initiative enabled customers in regulated sectors (government, healthcare, defense, and banking) to deploy applications with minimal effort while avoiding on-premises hardware costs. The solution addresses scalability limitations that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic and simplifies the deployment of high-load applications through platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Minimal Effort Application Deployment
**Status: APPROVED**

Accenture successfully built a scalable system that enables customers in regulated sectors to deploy applications with minimal effort. The solution was specifically designed to remove complexity from the deployment process while maintaining security standards required by organizations handling sensitive data in healthcare, government, financial, and national security sectors.

**Supporting Evidence:**
> "Learn how Accenture built a scalable system for Blueriq on AWS that enables customers in regulated sectors to securely deploy applications with minimal effort."

### C2: Elimination of On-Premises Hardware Costs
**Status: APPROVED**

The platform solution allows customers to avoid significant on-premises hardware investments by moving to a cloud-based PaaS model. This addresses both cost concerns and scalability limitations that customers experienced with traditional on-premises deployments.

**Supporting Evidence:**
> "He wanted to make the Blueriq Platform available as a PaaS solution so customers could deploy new Blueriq-based applications in the cloud without running into scaling limitations or incurring on-premises hardware costs."

### C3: Accelerated Process Automation and Deployment
**Status: APPROVED**

The solution significantly reduces the time required for customers to identify processes suitable for automation and deploy corresponding Blueriq applications. This improvement addresses the need for rapid response capabilities that became critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Supporting Evidence:**
> "Versluis wanted to reduce the complexity of deploying large Blueriq applications and help customers speed up the time it took to identify a process for automation and to deploy a Blueriq application."

### C4: Simplified High-Load Application Management
**Status: APPROVED**

The platform makes it easier for customers to deploy high-load applications while simplifying the management of complex configurations. This capability is particularly important for organizations that experienced unprecedented demand during the pandemic.

**Supporting Evidence:**
> "We wanted to make it easier for customers to deploy high-load Blueriq applications and simplify the task of managing complex configurations"
