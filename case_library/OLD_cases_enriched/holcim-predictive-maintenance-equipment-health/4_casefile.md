# Holcim Digital Logistics and Delivery Optimization Case File

## Executive Summary

Holcim, a global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions, successfully implemented a digital transformation initiative using AWS and HERE Technologies to optimize concrete delivery operations. The company developed the ConcreteDirect mobile app to address the time-sensitive nature of concrete delivery (90-minute shelf life) while supporting sustainability goals. The implementation resulted in significant operational improvements including 7-minute faster deliveries, 800,000 hours saved across 200,000 job sites, and successful delivery of 6.4 million concrete loads on time. This digital solution supports Holcim's 2050 net-zero target and 24% reduction in downstream transportation emissions by 2030.
