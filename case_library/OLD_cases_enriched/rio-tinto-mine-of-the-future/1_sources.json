Research industry trends, compare companies and get weekly market intelligence with Robotics 24/7.\nGetty Images\nRio Tinto was founded in 1873.\nGudai-Darii, mining company Rio Tinto\u2019s most technologically advanced mine, was officially opened today in the Pilbara region of Australia.\nWith an expected life of more than 40 years and an annual capacity of 43 million tons, Gudai-Darri will underpin future production of Rio Tinto\u2019s Pilbara Blend product. It\u2019s expected to increase iron ore production volumes and improve product mix from the Pilbara from the second half of this year. The mine is expected to reach capacity in 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with both the Banjima and Yindjibarndi People through the planning and development stages of Gudai-Darri and we look forward to partnering with them into the future to ensure the project achieves significant social and economic benefits,\u201d said Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott.\n\u201cGudai-Darri represents a step-change in the deployment of automation and technology within our iron ore business and a fantastic demonstration of the talent, ingenuity and capability that exists in Western Australia, a region which is now known globally for its technical excellence and innovation, he added.\u201cGudai-Darri's combination of data and analytics, machine learning and automation, will make this mine safer and more productive.\nTo optimize mine safety and drive productivity, Gudai-Darri features a deployment of industry-leading technologies, the London-based company said. This includes the use of robotics for the ore sampling laboratory as well as for distribution of parts in the new workshop.\nThe mine feature autonomous 23 CAT 793F autonomous haul trucks and three CAT MD6310 autonomous drills. Once development is complete, it is anticipated that Caterpillar 793 zero-emissions autonomous haul trucks will be deployed for the first time at Gudai-Darri. The trucks implement real-time ore tracking using sensors to provide live dig face progression, while data-informed modelling from the drills helps to build more accurate assessments of existing ground conditions and improve safety.\nNew autonomous water cart vehicles, developed in partnership with Caterpillar, will be primarily used for dust suppression on site, enhancing productivity by enabling mine operations to digitally track water consumption and reduce waste. The vehicle\u2019s intelligent on-board system detects dry and dusty conditions on site, triggering the application of water to roads to keep them in good condition.\nThe online publication Mining Technology found that the number of robotic related hirings in the mining industry rose 17.9% compared to last year.\nAlso included in the new mine is a full digital replica of the processing plant, which allows teams to monitor and respond to data collected from the plant. The same digital asset data is used to provide a feature rich, interactive 3D environment for virtual reality training. These autonomous assets are monitored remotely from Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre 1,500 km (932 mi.) away in Perth.\nThe heavy mobile equipment (HME) warehouse is the home to four automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) designed to automate the handling of pallet frames. The introduction of AGV\u2019s to the warehouse will reduce manual handling and improve safety with the introduction of laser obstacle scanners and auto stop functions, the company said.\nGudai-Darri brings together a suite of other innovations, including, Rio Tinto\u2019s first rotable bucketwheel reclaimer, a robotic ore-sampling laboratory, and a solar farm consisting of 83,000 solar panels.\nThe mine\u2019s footprint extends from Banjima county to Yinjibarndi country where a section of the new 166-km rail line (103 mi.) was constructed.\nSince development begun in April 2019, more than 14 million workhours have culminated in the delivery of Rio Tinto\u2019s 17th and most technologically advanced iron ore mine in the Pilbara.\nDevelopment of the mine supported more than 3,000 jobs during the construction and design phase with the operation requiring around 600 permanent roles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be here today to celebrate this momentous occasion,\" said Bill Johnston, minister for mines and petroleum and energy for Western Australia. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by Rio Tinto\u2019s innovation and sustainability; this is a prototype of the mine of the future. Once the new solar farm is complete, it will be able to power one-third of Gudai-Darri\u2019s operational needs with renewable energy.\n\u201cThis multi-billion-dollar investment in Western Australia, is great for the economy and its 40-year mine life will support thousands of jobs into the future,\u201d he added.\nA total of A$3.2 billion ($2.2 billion U.S.) in goods and services were sourced within Western Australia (WA) during the construction phase o"

      "content": "Rio Tinto has revealed plans to create its first \u201cintelligent\u201d mine, where all assets are networked together and capable of making decisions themselves \u201cin a microsecond\u201d.\nThe enormous project was disclosed at an iron ore site tour that kicked off yesterday, and is the likely successor to Rio Tinto\u2019s now decade old \u2018Mine of the Future\u2019 program.\nBack in March, the miner suggested that it would need to invest significant resources into data science in the future, but did not reveal exactly why.\nNow it is clear: the company plans to build on its autonomous capabilities by making the pit-to-port process as integrated and intelligent as possible, placing decision-making with the machines themselves.\nIt appears the first mines to be given this level of \u201cintelligence\u201d will be new ones, rather than those kitted out under Mine of the Future.\n\u201cThe mines in our study pipeline will be established with leading edge technology, including automated trucks, drills and trains but also for the first time systems connecting all components of the dynamic schedule, from [the] customer right through to orebody planning,\u201d managing director of planning, integration and assets Kellie Parker said.\nThe first intelligent mine is set to be Koodaideri, which will deliver its first tonnes of ore in 2021, assuming it meets regulatory approvals.\n\u201cKoodaideri will adopt many new processes and technologies and will deliver world first performance by being safe, smarter and more productive than any other mine,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cWe are assessing over 100 innovation opportunities which will make this our first intelligent mine.\n\u201cOne such initiative is digital twinning. We are building a replica digital plant that collects all the data on the plant from design, build, commissioning and operation.\n\u201cThis allows work to change through augmented reality.\u201d\nThe digital twin model was first created by NASA but has been heavily adopted in industrial sectors such as manufacturing in recent years.\nIt involves creating a living virtual model or simulation of a physical environment. They take real-time data from the physical environment, where it can be used to quickly test scenarios that could optimise production or operations.\nParker noted that Rio Tinto\u2019s digital twin would be \u201ca living model which is linked to a data lake with a number of pieces of static and dynamic information contained within.\u201d\n\u201cFrom a field or remote location our operators will have access to this data, and coupled with analytics and machine learning, will drive business related outcomes in a shorter time and with greater accuracy.\n\u201cImportantly, this data is the heart of our digital twin - and is also used to simulate plant operation and to optimise the plant control systems parameters.\u201d\nParker said that a number of \u201cvirtual reality modules are being developed\u201d that look at a range of complex maintenance activities.\n\u201cThis allows a highly interactive and engaging method of training which ensures better task retention and competency from our operators,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn addition to VR we are also investing in 360 degree capture of complex tasks as in the example you see here.\n\u201cThis will also be available \u2018on demand\u2019 for our workers who want to access this at any time.\u201d\nData-driven integration\nRio Tinto spent considerable time talking up the benefits of more strongly integrating its mine assets.\nThe miner said that it had to be better able to anticipate customer orders and market shifts, and to be able to adjust its operations accordingly.\n\u201cWe are now evolving from a traditional push system to a truly market-led supply chain,\u201d vice president of sales and marketing Simon Farry said.\n\u201cWe already have a number of examples of the additional value that can be generated when we are able to respond to the market in a dynamic way.\u201d\nFarry said that some elements of integrated mining were already in place.\nHe said that in late 2017, the company set up \u201ca targeted approach to bring forward the supply of Pilbara Blend lump when premiums were at an all-time high\u201d.\nPilbara Blend is a specific product marketed by Rio Tinto that combines iron ores from across its operations.\nThe \u201ctargeted approach\u201d has now been \u201csystemised \u2026 underpinned by data analytics and real time data visualisation that enables an agile response to market demand for lump.\u201d\nFarry said that the initial project had been successful, \u201cextracting around US$10 million ($13.47 million) of additional value.\u201d\nHe suggested that a much larger body of data science work was also underway.\n\u201cWe are currently experimenting with machine learning and predictive analytics to anticipate market conditions and enable better decision making,\u201d he said.\n\u201cReal-time data visualisation has supported tighter linkages between our Pilbara operations and our sales and marketing hub in Singapore, increasing our agility from mine to market.\u201d\nParker also highlighted a series of \u201cintegrated planning\u201d projects that had been delivered to date.\nShe said the systems helped Rio"
