This is the mining industry\u2019s first AHS enabled to run on private LTE in commercial operations, making way for ultra-high system availability and reliability, while adhering to Komatsu\u2019s renowned safety standards.\nKomatsu\u2019s FrontRunner AHS allows unmanned operation of ultra-class mining trucks and is critical to the mining industry. FrontRunner delivers significant benefits, including reduced worker exposure to harm, protocols designed to constantly improve mine-site safety, reduced operating costs, and increased productivity and efficiency. The company completed a year-long qualification program at the company\u2019s proving grounds in Tucson, Arizona, conducting extensive testing of the FrontRunner AHS on Nokia\u2019s Future X infrastructure, a leading provider of private LTE communication solutions for the mining industry.\nMining operators demand wireless networks with high-availability, seamless mobility, world class Quality of Service (QoS), and the ability to support multiple applications and services simultaneously. Accordingly, the industry is moving away from less predictable wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, and towards private LTE networks, that improve security, capacity, and overall performance within a multi-application environment.\n\u201cThis industry milestone represents a key step in Komatsu\u2019s exploration of private LTE and highlights Nokia\u2019s role as the leading global supplier of mission-critical solutions and services for the mining industry,\u201d said Luiz Steinberg, Komatsu Global Officer and President/CEO of Modular Mining Systems. \u201cAs the leader in autonomous haulage technology, we are firmly on our way to helping the industry move the next billion tons of material with autonomous technology. We have come together with Nokia to further this vision of delivering increased value to the mining industry.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited to be engaging the mining automation market with Komatsu, a powerhouse in the industry, to further highlight the benefits of Future X for mining companies as a strategic advantage in their operations,\u201d said Kathrin Buvac, President of Nokia Enterprise. \u201cPrivate LTE is a key element in the Nokia Bell Labs Future X architecture to help industries such as mining create an intelligent, dynamic, high-performance network that increases the safety, productivity and efficiency of their business.\u201d\nKomatsu pioneered the first AHS for the mining industry with a commercial deployment in 2008 at CODELCO\u2019s Gabriela Mistral (Gaby) copper mine in Chile. Komatsu\u2019s ongoing commitment to accelerate the pace of AHS adoption and innovation is reflected in the company\u2019s other recent milestone \u2013 supporting customers to move two billion tons of surface material in the copper, iron ore, and oil sands industries autonomously. Komatsu also continues to pursue a long-term strategy to standardize interoperability of mixed fleet autonomous vehicles to maximize efficiency and safety at mine sites worldwide.\nKomatsu America Corp. is a U.S. subsidiary of Komatsu Ltd., the world\u2019s second largest manufacturer and supplier of earth-moving equipment, consisting of construction, mining and compact construction equipment. Komatsu America also serves the forklift and forestry markets. Through its distributor network, Komatsu offers a state-of-the-art parts and service program to support its equipment.
