      "content": "Our process\nDuarte proactively led a series of brainstorms, pitched ideas, and pivoted direction as we learned more about the top-secret technology and product announcements Salesforce would be unveiling.\nSalesforce is known for innovation in its CRM platform and its company culture, both of which are showcased at its annual conference, Dreamforce. The world\u2019s largest software conference, Dreamforce gathers the brightest minds in tech from around the globe to network, learn, and get excited about the latest Salesforce updates and announcements. The showpiece of this immersive event is Marc Benioff\u2019s opening keynote \u2014 and the bar is high.\nAudiences expect great things from Dreamforce. So, every year the event team is challenged to deliver an even more breathtaking presentation that\u2019s worthy of a global tech powerhouse. When it was time to launch Einstein AI, the keynote needed to clearly explain this new technology while creating an unforgettable, \u201cWOW\u201d moment! Based on Duarte\u2019s reputation for pioneering jaw-dropping presentations, Salesforce knew we were up to the task.\nIndustry\nServices\nThe big challenge\nSalesforce, the global leader in CRM, had big things planned for their annual Dreamforce event. The showpiece of this immersive event was Marc Benioff\u2019s opening keynote \u2014 and the bar was high.\nThey needed to introduce and spark buzz around Einstein, the world\u2019s first generative AI technology for CRM. Because Dreamforce is the world\u2019s largest software conference that gathers the brightest minds in tech to network and learn, they needed an innovative, experienced partner who could help them nail this high-stakes moment. Getting folks excited about the latest product updates and announcements is as much an art as it is a science.\nThe event team asked us to dream big \u2026 and we did. Working closely with them over nine months, the Duarte team planned and designed an immersive, cinematic visual experience that would capture the essence of Einstein and captivate the audience.\nThe results\nWhen 170,000 people watching onsite (and 15 million watching online) saw Einstein interacting with Benioff and Harris, the buzz meter flew into overdrive. The groundbreaking AI innovation drew press coverage in Fortune, Forbes, Business Insider, TechCrunch, Bloomberg, and USA Today reinforced Salesforce\u2019s leadership as a tech disruptor on a global scale.\nPeople watching\n70,000 people watching onsite (and 15 million watching online).\nPredictions daily\nAccording to Salesfoce, Einstein makes more than 80 billion predictions daily, showcasing its power and dominance in AI.\nMajor buzz from the launch\nFortune, Forbes, Business Insider, TechCrunch, Bloomberg, USA Today, among others reinforced Salesforce as a tech disruptor.\n\u201cWe put a strong premium on story and presentations, and Duarte is world-class at both.\u201d"

[toc=Einstein AI Overview]\nSalesforce Einstein represents the first generation of AI integration within the Salesforce ecosystem, launched around 2018-2019 as a collection of machine learning capabilities embedded across Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Service Cloud. Unlike standalone AI platforms, Einstein was designed as an integrated layer that leverages existing Salesforce data to provide predictive analytics, lead scoring, and automated insights directly within familiar CRM workflows.\nEinstein's Core Architecture and Components\nEinstein operates on traditional machine learning algorithms rather than modern generative AI frameworks. The platform consists of several key components:\nEinstein Lead Scoring: Uses historical data patterns to rank prospects based on likelihood to convert, analyzing factors like email engagement, website behavior, and demographic information.\nEinstein Opportunity Insights: Provides deal-level predictions and risk assessments by examining past won/lost patterns, competitor mentions, and engagement trends.\nEinstein Activity Capture: Automatically logs emails and calendar events into Salesforce records, though this feature has known limitations in accurately attributing activities to the correct opportunities.\nRecognizing Einstein's limitations, Salesforce introduced AgentForce as its next-generation AI platform, focusing primarily on customer success and support rather than sales applications. AgentForce incorporates more advanced LLM capabilities but maintains the same integration-heavy approach that requires extensive configuration and ongoing maintenance.\nUser Experience Reality\nReal user feedback reveals significant gaps between Einstein's marketing promises and operational reality:\n\"Einstein employs Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to analyze data to predict sales outcomes, provide insights into customers, and even automate routine tasks. However, it has issues related to data storage and migration that need to be addressed in updates.\" \u00e2 Product Manager, Education Sector Gartner Verified Review\n\"Few teething problems and sometime the AI doesn't bring back the particular insights we're looking for so we have had to go back to the old ways with deadlines but that could be down to user error.\" \u00e2 Finance Associate, Consumer Goods Gartner Verified Review\nEinstein's Position in Modern AI Landscape\nEinstein's 2018-2019 architecture places it firmly in the \"pre-generative AI\" category, lacking the contextual understanding and autonomous capabilities that define modern AI platforms. While Salesforce has added some LLM features, the core platform remains built on older machine learning approaches that require extensive manual configuration and ongoing user training.\nKey Limitations:\nBuilt on outdated ML algorithms without deep LLM integration\nRequires multiple expensive"
