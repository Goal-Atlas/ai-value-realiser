# Tata Tea Jaago Re AI Climate Campaign Case File

## Executive Summary

Tata Consumer Products Limited launched an AI-powered climate action campaign called "Har Green Action se Farak Padega" through their Tata Tea Jaago Re platform. The initiative uses Google Cloud's AI suite, particularly Gemini, to verify user-submitted photos of eco-friendly actions and provide real-time environmental impact calculations. Built on WhatsApp and deployed in 3-4 weeks, the platform achieved significant scale, reaching 200 million people within two months of launch.

The campaign addresses climate change apathy by demonstrating how individual actions collectively create meaningful environmental impact. Users submit photos of green actions (using public transport, cooking with lids, bucket bathing, etc.), which are verified by AI in 10-15 seconds compared to the previous 5-minute manual process.

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- 30-40% infrastructure cost reduction using Cloud Run
- 2-3x faster data processing with BigQuery
- 200 million people reached in 2 months
- 150,000 website visitors for tool information
