# Case File: TQL Automation and AI for Scale, Growth, and Service Levels

## Executive Summary

Total Quality Logistics (TQL) demonstrates a comprehensive approach to leveraging automation and AI technologies to achieve significant business scale and growth while maintaining high service levels. As the largest privately owned company in Greater Cincinnati with 8,723 U.S.-based employees, TQL has successfully integrated daily automation and AI tools to streamline high-volume processes, enabling their workforce to focus on higher-value activities like service delivery, problem-solving, and relationship building.

TQL operates at impressive scale, with brokers handling 75-100 sales calls daily, contributing to the broader transportation logistics industry's remarkable growth from $57 billion to over $213.5 billion between 2000-2018.

Despite the high-volume, high-pressure nature of the logistics industry, TQL maintains superior employee satisfaction (83% vs. 57% industry average) and retention rates (51% higher than typical U.S. workplaces), suggesting their automation and AI investments effectively support both operational efficiency and employee experience.
