# Case File: Globo's Digital Transformation and Cloud Migration

## Executive Summary

Globo, Latin America's largest media company, has undergone a comprehensive digital transformation journey since 2018, transitioning from traditional broadcast operations to a cloud-native "mediatech" model. The company partnered with Google Cloud, Globant, CREE8, and HP Anyware to modernize its infrastructure, implement AI/ML-driven advertising platforms, and enable remote production workflows.

Key initiatives include the deployment of Cloud Live Production for over 50 events in 2021, the development of Globo Ads and Globo SIM advertising platforms, and the migration of VFX workflows to the cloud. While the transformation has enabled operational flexibility and new business models, many performance claims lack specific quantifiable metrics, requiring further verification for complete validation.
