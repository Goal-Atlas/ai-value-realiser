  "tier_verification": "This case appears to be misclassified as tier 1. All claims describe operational excellence, efficiency improvements, and scale achievements within a traditional digital banking model. While Nubank executes exceptionally well, there's no evidence of business model transformation, new market creation, or AI as a core value driver. This should be classified as tier 1 (optimization) rather than tier 1 (transformation). The 'remove the AI' test: if you removed AI/ML from Nubank, you'd still have a digital bank - just less efficient. The core banking model remains unchanged."
