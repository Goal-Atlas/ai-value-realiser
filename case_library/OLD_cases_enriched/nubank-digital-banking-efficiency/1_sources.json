      "content": "Nubank is pioneering the new \u201cdigital-first\u201d era of banking with Twilio\nTime to read:\nChallenge\nNubank needed to deliver an amazing customer experience that lived up to the brand\u2019s reputation, with opportunities for customization, channel diversity, and of course\u2014stability and security.\nSolution\nTwilio Flex and SendGrid provided Nubank with a completely customizable and scalable solution to serve customers conveniently no matter which channels they prefer.\nFounded in May 2013, Nubank already has great results for a fintech company that has less than 10 years in the market. In less than a year after its launch, fintech presented its first product, the famous purple credit card with the Mastercard brand. After 4 years of this launch, Nubank has achieved unicorn startup status and is today one of the world\u2019s largest digital banking platforms, serving around 54 million customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.\nAs a company that defines itself as in the technology sector, Nubank leverages data and design to generate an excellent customer experience, thus offering financial services that not only meet user needs but truly differentiate in the sector.\nFocusing on a user experience different from other technologies already on the market, Nubank membership is not just for customers who are tired of the bureaucracy of traditional banks. The reality is that the elderly are part of this slice. In 2020, fintech registered a growing membership of people over 60. Between April and June of 2021, the volume of new customers in this range was 50 percent higher than in the same period in 2019.\nGiven these numbers and to serve its different audiences with mastery, Nubank aims to contribute to a long-term relationship with its users, based mainly on trust, with the concept of \u201cdigital-first\u201d being its foundation.\n\u201cCustomers no longer accept being treated the way they are treated by traditional banks \u2014 and that tends to get even stronger over time,\u201d Nubank co-founder Cristina Junqueira said. \u201cIt is worth mentioning that Nubank\u2019s service is supported by four pillars: anticipating, solving, caring, and training. In addition to offering practical products and incredible service, we maintain a fully transparent relationship with our customers.\u201d\nInnovation is in the DNA\nThe pandemic further accelerated the digitization that was already being done by Nubank. In the first quarter of 2020, the bank registered an average of 42 thousand new users per day, in addition to offering special refinancing conditions with lower interest rates and extended payment terms to customers.\nThe purpose of the action was to support them in times of economic instability. However, it was not just customers who received help at that time, employees also had the full support and were one of the first banking teams to adopt the home office model.\nAdapting to changes has always been part of Nubank\u2019s DNA as fintech was born in the biggest Brazilian crisis. \u201cMy motivation is to keep the promise we made to our millions of customers, offering a transparent, easy-to-understand, and hassle-free banking experience that allows them to be the best financier possible and revolutionize the financial sector in Latin America,\u201d Junqueira emphasized. \u201cThis is a region of great inequality, where about 30 percent, 55 percent, and 65 percent of the populations of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, respectively, currently unbanked (as of 2017, according to the World Bank). Being able to contribute significantly to financial inclusion and digitalization throughout Latin America is one of the main drivers of my career and Nubank as a whole.\u201d\nThe future of communications with Twilio\nFaced with this new reality, Twilio became a partner in the bank\u2019s customer engagement strategy. Among the main benefits, it was possible to notice more autonomy, in addition to scaling with more confidence. \u201cWe achieved more stability and security in the assistance and more robust contingency plans. The platform is highly customizable and allows us to develop several functionalities over time,\u201d Junqueira said.\nCurrently, Twilio Flex is used to serve customers through voice channels, emergency calls (ombudsman), sending alerts via SMS, and information and campaigns through Sendgrid.\n\u201cWe chose Twilio over other platforms because it gave us a huge opportunity for improvement compared to the older platform we were using. Some of the things that caught our attention were the analytical solutions within Flex, the opportunity for customization, and the diversification of channels that Twilio offers\u2014email, SMS, WhatsApp, and VoIP telephone,\u201d said Yuri Cruz, the product manager for Nubank channels.\nAnother benefit of using Twilio Flex highlighted by fintech was the support service that helped to build the ideal solution for the company. \u201cThe support helped us discover out-of-the-box solutions and troubleshoot technical integration issues quickly and effectively,\u201d added Cruz.\n\"We chose Twilio over other platforms "

      "content": "Nubank\u2019s Customer Growth Playbook Is Written in NPS and Word of Mouth\nNPS is a widely used customer experience metric that gauges how likely users are to recommend a company to others. Calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (unhappy customers) from promoters (loyal enthusiasts), it gives a score between -100 and +100. A higher NPS indicates a strong base of promoters\u2014customers who are not just satisfied, but willing to actively refer others.\nMore customer-obsessed than Amazon. More beloved than Starbucks. A digital bank with 115M+ users \u2013 built with empathy and scaled with trust.\nLatin America\u2019s beloved purple giant, Nubank, has achieved what most banks spend billions chasing: sustained, organic growth at scale. Since 2015, it has added nearly 13 million customers every year on average. But here\u2019s what\u2019s remarkable: 80% of that growth comes from word-of-mouth referrals alone.\nAt the heart of this engine is one number \u2013 its Net Promoter Score (NPS). Clocking in at 90, nearly three times higher than incumbents and other major local fintechs, it\u2019s far from a vanity metric. It\u2019s the flywheel fuel behind Nubank\u2019s near-zero customer acquisition cost (CAC) model, where every delighted customer brings in the next, turning experience into exponential scale.\nIn an industry riddled with churn, marketing bloat, and rising CACs, Nubank has hacked growth through trust and transparency. Here\u2019s how NPS became the foundation of its word-of-mouth engine, turning everyday delighted users into its most effective acquisition channel.\nThe Foundation Behind Nubank\u2019s Consistent NPS\nNubank\u2019s NPS acts as the entry point to a tightly engineered growth system. For five consecutive years, this score has held steady, underpinned by consistent design decisions rooted in real customer needs that make every interaction feel intentional:\nNubank's Deep Dive Report \ud83d\udcd4\nWhiteSight\u2019s latest deep dive distills the plays, pivots, and product bets that fuel Nubank\u2019s rise across LATAM.\n- Proactive customer support and education: 94% of customer calls are answered in under 45 seconds. Most are resolved by Nubank\u2019s own trained professionals, \u201cXpeers\u201d, at the first touchpoint. But Nubank goes further. Its \u201cNu WOWs\u201d focuses on sending Nu gifts, particularly when a connection stands out between the Xpeers and the customer. The SOS Nu platform adds another layer\u2014a comprehensive hub educating users on scams and thefts through real-time, actionable tips.\nFinancial education has always been one of our pillars, and it is also present in the design of our products and services to empower consumers to make the best decisions for their lives and have control over their money. Advancing the literacy journey on these topics brings greater and more sustainable benefits not only to individuals, but to the community as a whole\nCristina Junqueira, Co-founder and CGO, Nubank\n- Product features that actually serve users: Nubank\u2019s Payments Assistant platform for bills and recurring transactions saved customers 750K+ hours in one year. Open finance-powered overdraft alerts helped avoid R$4M in interest in just a month. And 1.4M users were nudged to act on idle funds via personalized notifications\u2014purposeful nudges that build daily utility.\n- Ultra-low complaint rates, high leadership visibility: Nubank received only 1,222 complaints per million users in Q4 2024. That\u2019s far lower than both incumbents (Itau: 4,127; Santander: 3,365) and new-age fintechs like PagBank (7,926) and Inter (7,496). Not just that\u2014even CEO David V\u00e9lez personally addresses customer grievances like this one.\nThis relentless focus on quality compounds customer love, which in turn becomes the bedrock for Nubank\u2019s flywheel.\nThe NPS Flywheel: How Customer Love Becomes a Scalable Acquisition Engine\nWhen users love the product, they spread it, powering a flywheel that scales at near-zero cost. This system helps Nubank run lean. The customer acquisition cost has held steady at $7 for both 2023 and 2024, up slightly from $6.5 in 2022, but still far below industry averages. These are the payoff of optimizing spend early and building a brand users trust enough to share.\nActivity metrics reinforce the health of this base. Nubank grew from 93.9M customers in 2023 to 114.3M in 2024\u2014adding over 20M users (22% YoY). Active users hit 94.9M in 2024, sustaining an 83% activity rate. And despite rising total customer base and sustained active customer base, cost to serve dropped to $0.8 per user, down from $0.9. This reflects the scalability of a digitally-native, automation-led operating model.\nFrom Satisfaction to Scale, the Nubank Way\nThis virtuous cycle\u2014where exceptional service drives advocacy, growth, and reinvestment\u2014explains why Nubank now outranks Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks in customer centricity. Its model demonstrates that customer satisfaction is not just about good ethics but also a sound business strategy. For digital banks, fintechs, and incumbents alike, Nubank\u2019s model offers a clear le"

      "content": "Until recently, most banks and financial organizations treated artificial intelligence (AI) as tomorrow\u2019s experiment. That changed in 2024\u2014the year AI stopped being a side project and became the engine of digital banking. Super-charged by breakthroughs in generative models and an investment rush, financial institutions everywhere began weaving AI into customer and employee touchpoints. The shift was dramatic: global AI adoption rocketed to 78% of all organizations\u2014up from just 20% in 2017\u2014while an extraordinary 91% of bank boards formally approved Gen-AI programs, according to NTT and McKinsey. The payoff is already visible in richer digital experiences, sharper personalization and faster, safer service. In other words, while banking\u2019s AI journey may be in its early chapters, chapter one has opened with a bang.\nIn banking, AI is no longer experimental\u2014it became a cornerstone of strategy for improving how customers engage with their banks online and via mobile. Within this article, we analyze how AI\u2019s adoption in 2024 impacted key areas of digital CX, highlighting global trends as well as specific insights from major markets like the US and UK. We examine both quantitative gains\u2014 such as higher customer satisfaction scores, rising self-service usage and digital adoption rates\u2014and qualitative developments, including more personalized services, smarter virtual assistants and greater accessibility in digital banking.\nOverall, banks that deployed AI at scale in 2024 reported significant improvements in digital channel usage and customer feedback. For example, Bank of America (US) announced its clients reached 26 billion digital interactions in 2024 (a 12% year-over-year increase), including 676 million interactions with its AI virtual assistant \u201cErica.\u201d In the UK, NatWest\u2019s AI assistant, \u201cCora,\u201d handled 11.2 million customer conversations in 2024, roughly equal to all interactions handled by the bank\u2019s call centers and branches.\nThese examples illustrate the global trend: AI is enabling higher engagement on digital platforms and scaling up customer support without sacrificing quality. At the same time, a J.D. Power survey shows consumers are largely optimistic about AI\u2019s benefits: 72% agree AI will deliver easy, convenient self-service but also highlight areas to improve, such as building trust and ensuring human-like empathy in AI interactions. In the sections below, we break down the impact by five key areas of customer experience: personalization, self-service, customer engagement, support automation and accessibility.\nMarket Impact: Banking Industry Leads in AI Adoption\nA McKinsey survey indicates that AI adoption is now mainstream across industries. Overall, about 78% of organizations worldwide report using some form of AI in at least one business function in 2024, a huge increase from just 20% in 2017. Within this landscape, banking/financial services is a leading adopter of AI.\nIDC estimates the banking industry will invest about $31.3 billion in AI in 2024, making it the second-largest industry for AI spending (after software/IT services at $33 billion and ahead of retail at approximately $25 billion). Together, software, banking and retail account for 38% of the global AI spend.\nThe years 2023\u20132024 saw an explosion of interest in generative AI (GenAI)\u2014AI that can produce human-like text, code, images, etc. And banking has been at the forefront of deploying generative AI compared to other sectors.\nGenAI Seduced Wall Street\nGlobally, generative AI usage by companies surged over the past year. By mid-2024, 71% of organizations reported using generative AI regularly in at least one business function, according to a McKinsey Global AI Survey. This suggests that across all industries, a majority have begun experimenting with or deploying GenAI.\nHowever, financial services firms are among the heaviest adopters. In a late 2024 cross-industry survey by SAS, banking and insurance executives reported the highest current usage of generative AI\u201460% in each sector are already using GenAI in some capacity, the top rate among industries. Banking was singled out as leading all industries in GenAI integration, with the most use cases deployed per organization (on average).\nAlmost every bank is at least planning for GenAI. A global survey found that 98% of banking leaders either use generative AI now (60%) or plan to within two years (38%). This virtually unanimous interest is unique\u2014other sectors showed lower current usage and more hesitancy. Banks also back up these plans with resources: 90% of banks surveyed have a dedicated GenAI budget for the coming year, indicating significant investment in AI talent and tools.\nFirst-Mover Advantage: Banking\u2019s AI Head-Start\nBanking (often grouped with finance/insurance) figures prominently among the industries with the highest AI adoption. Research by IBM found that about 50% of enterprises in financial services have actively deployed AI, the highest of any sector. By comparison, t"
