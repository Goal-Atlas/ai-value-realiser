# Case File: Nubank's Digital-First Banking Platform

## Executive Summary

Nubank has established itself as Latin America's largest digital banking platform, serving over 114 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia through a completely digital-first approach. The company has achieved remarkable growth metrics, adding over 20 million users in 2024 alone (22% year-over-year growth) while maintaining exceptionally low customer acquisition costs of $7 and industry-leading customer satisfaction scores.

The bank's success is built on a foundation of operational excellence, with 94% of customer calls answered in under 45 seconds and a Net Promoter Score of 90 - nearly three times higher than traditional incumbents. Nubank's digital-native approach has enabled significant cost efficiencies, with cost-to-serve dropping to $0.8 per user while maintaining an 83% customer activity rate. The company's growth engine is powered primarily by word-of-mouth referrals, which account for 80% of new customer acquisition, demonstrating the strength of their customer experience model.

- **Claim**: Nubank serves around 54 million customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia
- **Evidence**: "Nubank has achieved unicorn startup status and is today one of the world's largest digital banking platforms, serving around 54 million customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia."
- **Source**: S2
- **Issue**: Large customer base indicates success but not strategic transformation - scale metrics don't demonstrate transformation
- **Recommendation**: Focus on how the digital-first model enables fundamentally different banking operations

**C2 - Daily User Acquisition (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Nubank registered 42,000 new users per day in Q1 2020
- **Evidence**: "In the first quarter of 2020, the bank registered an average of 42 thousand new users per day"

- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Elderly customer growth increased 50% between 2019-2021
- **Evidence**: "Between April and June of 2021, the volume of new customers in this range was 50 percent higher than in the same period in 2019."
