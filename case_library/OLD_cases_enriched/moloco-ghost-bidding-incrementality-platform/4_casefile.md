# Case File: Moloco's AI-Powered Performance Advertising and Incrementality Platform

## Executive Summary

Moloco operates an AI-powered performance advertising platform that enables businesses to optimize their advertising spend across multiple channels beyond traditional platforms like Google and Meta. The company's machine learning engine provides real-time bid optimization, incrementality measurement, and cross-channel attribution to help advertisers achieve measurable outcomes including specific ROAS targets and cost-per-order goals.

The platform has demonstrated significant value across multiple verticals including retail media networks, mobile app advertising, and connected TV (CTV) advertising. Key achievements include helping advertisers achieve up to 214% improvement in ROAS through channel diversification, delivering 400% ROAS targets with precision, and achieving 93-96% completion rates for CTV campaigns. The company's approach focuses on outcome-based advertising rather than traditional impression-based models, positioning it as a solution for advertisers seeking measurable returns in uncertain economic conditions.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - 400% ROAS Achievement (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Moloco's platform delivers 400% return on ad spend (ROAS)
- **Evidence**: "Enter retail media networks (RMNs)—uniquely positioned to sell not just ad space, but outcomes like a 400% return on ad spend (ROAS) or even a cost-per-order (CPO). At Moloco, our machine learning platform has powered advertisers to hit these targets with precision"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Generic performance claim without specific client attribution or independent verification. Reads like marketing copy.
- **Recommendation**: Provide specific client case studies with verified results and independent validation

- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Moloco's predictive engine delivers 3x higher ROAS vs. legacy RMNs

- **Status**: REJECTED

- **Evidence**: "A TV spot may drive reach, but a $10,000 sponsored product campaign on an RMN can drive $40,000 in sales—and prove it with closed-loop attribution... An RMN can serve a Samsung ad, track the $800 sale, and show a 5:1 ROAS"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Hypothetical example ('A TV spot may...') rather than specific case study. No named client or verified results.
- **Recommendation**: Replace with actual client case study with verified results and attribution
