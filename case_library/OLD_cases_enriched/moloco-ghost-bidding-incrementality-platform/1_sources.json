      "content": "Blog Article\nWith U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods climbing higher, potential for price increases, supply chain snarls persisting, and macroeconomic uncertainty, marketers are on edge. Global advertising budgets are already tightening, and brands are zeroing in on channels that deliver measurable bang for their buck. Enter retail media networks (RMNs)\u00e2uniquely positioned to sell not just ad space, but outcomes like a 400% return on ad spend (ROAS) or even a cost-per-order (CPO).\nAt Moloco, our machine learning platform has powered advertisers to hit these targets with precision, leveraging real-time inferences and first-party data. As global ad spend wavers, RMNs that connect ads to transactions and guarantee returns are set to thrive.\n\u00e2The game\u00e2s changed,\u00e2 said a VP at a top-tier RMN. \u00e2In this economy, advertisers won\u00e2t settle for reach\u00e2they\u00e2re demanding revenue. Retail media can deliver that certainty.\u00e2\nHere\u00e2s why now\u00e2s the time for RMNs to lean into outcomes\u00e2and how they can pull it off.\nAdvertising spend has long mirrored economic cycles. According to GroupM\u00e2s 2025 forecast, global ad spend will eclipse $1 trillion this year for the first time, a modest 5.8% increase from 2024\u00e2down from the 10.2% surge in 2021\u00e2s post-pandemic rebound. But dig deeper, and the story shifts: digital, which now accounts for 78% of total US ad spend, is growing at 7.1%, while traditional channels like TV and print lag at 2.3%. Why? Digital offers accountability\u00e2especially when tied to sales.\nIn uncertain times, this pro-cyclicality sharpens. During the 2008 recession, U.S. ad spend dropped nearly 18%, with discretionary channels like newspapers hit hardest (-27%), while performance-driven search ads held steady. Today, with tariffs threatening to spike retail prices, marketers are again prioritizing certainty. Retail media, projected to reach $141 billion globally in 2025, is eating share from social and display\u00e2up 18% year-over-year\u00e2because it\u00e2s tethered to transactions.\nNot all ad dollars are equal. A TV spot may drive reach, but a $10,000 sponsored product campaign on an RMN can drive $40,000 in sales\u00e2and prove it with closed-loop attribution. In a tariff-heavy economy, advertisers need that proof. They want a reliable return.\nRMNs excel here. With first-party data\u00e2say, a shopper\u00e2s search for \u00e2winter boots\u00e2 or a cart abandoned with a $50 jacket\u00e2they can target intent with laser focus. Moloco\u00e2s ML models take it further, optimizing bids in real time to hit a target ROAS or a specific cost per order.\n\u00e2Outcomes shift the conversation,\u00e2 a Head of Media at a mid-tier retailer told me at a recent industry conference. \u00e2We\u00e2re not selling ad slots\u00e2we\u00e2re selling incremental revenue. That\u00e2s what brands ultimately want.\u00e2\nRMNs live where purchases happen\u00e2on product pages, in search results, at checkout. That closeness is a superpower. A shopper browsing \u00e24K TVs\u00e2 on a retailer\u00e2s site isn\u00e2t just curious\u00e2they\u00e2re in buying mode. An RMN can serve a Samsung ad, track the $800 sale, and show a 5:1 ROAS.\nAt a recent conference, an agency lead called out explicitly \u00e2we don\u00e2t see any reductions to budgets for commerce.\u00e2 In uncertain times, the \u00e2sure bets\u00e2 are where brands double down.\nThis matters especially as costs rise. With tariffs potentially adding $78 billion to U.S. consumer goods prices, every ad dollar needs to pull its weight. Moloco\u00e2s predictive engine adjusts campaigns on the fly\u00e2boosting bids for high-intent users, dialing back on tire-kickers\u00e2delivering 3x higher ROAS vs. legacy RMNs with static ad models. For RMNs, it\u00e2s a chance to pitch: \u00e2We don\u00e2t guess\u00e2we guarantee.\u00e2\nRMNs that cling to impression-based or CPC-based bidding models are playing a losing game. Amazon\u00e2s Retail Ad Service, launched in January 2025, already claims a growing share of U.S. retail media spend, blending onsite tech with native demand. Smaller RMNs risk irrelevance if they don\u00e2t counter with outcome-driven offerings.\nThe stakes are high, with many advertisers likely to shift budgets to platforms with proven ROI if RMNs don\u00e2t adapt.\nSelling outcomes sounds complex, but it doesn\u00e2t have to be. Moloco\u00e2s ML-powered commerce media platform makes it seamless:\nWhat will happen with tariffs in 90 days? No one knows. Inflation might climb. Consumer confidence might tank. But RMNs can sell certainty. By tying ads to outcomes, they turn economic headwinds into tailwinds, proving their worth one sale at a time.\nMoloco\u00e2s ML optimizes for outcomes in real time, at a campaign/SKU level, delivering unparalleled returns for advertisers. Through millisecond-level decisions and continuous learning, our platform adapts to shifting shopper behavior instantly, maintaining performance even as market conditions change.\nIn a world where every cent counts, certainty isn\u00e2t just a perk\u00e2it\u00e2s the whole game. Ready to turn uncertainty into opportunity? Start with Moloco today.\nThe holiday shopping season brings a massive surge of high-intent traffic to e-commerce platforms. While this spik"

      "content": "August 12, 2025\nRedwood City, Calif. \u00e2 Aug 12, 2025 \u00e2 Moloco, the AI performance advertising company, today released new research on the growing disparity between mobile app advertising spend and consumer attention. The new research study, Performance Through Independence: Unlocking Incremental App Growth Beyond Google and Meta, shows that even as mobile attention shifts to millions of mobile apps, mobile marketing spend remains highly concentrated with Google and Meta which today attract 88% of consumer mobile app advertising dollars. The report, developed in collaboration with Sensor Tower and Singular, shows that advertisers can increase financial returns by up to 214% by adjusting their advertising mix to reach users across the broad range of mobile apps where users now spend time.\n\u00e2Too many advertisers are still over-indexing on Google and Meta. But the biggest returns we are seeing are happening outside big tech,\u00e2 said Tom Shadbolt, Senior Insights Manager, Moloco. \u00e2The independent app ecosystem is quickly becoming the new engine for predictable and long-term performance. This research is a wake-up call for mobile app marketers.\u00e2\nConsumer mobile apps, including all mobile app categories outside of gaming, such as entertainment, finance, delivery, and more, have experienced significant revenue growth in 2024, with in-app purchase (IAP) and subscription revenues rising 25% to reach $70.5 billion. The growth trajectory is accelerating, and for the first time, consumer mobile app revenue is projected to surpass gaming revenue within the next two years. Moloco\u00e2s research study highlights key takeaways for consumer mobile app advertisers to take advantage of this incremental growth opportunity.\u00c2\nThe study revealed that:\u00c2\n- Consumer mobile app advertising spend remains heavily skewed toward Google and Meta, despite shifting user behavior. In 2024, mobile app revenue jumped 25%, yet 88% of marketing budgets stayed concentrated in big tech platforms\u00e2an imbalance that fails to reflect where users actually spend their time.\n- Diversification of ad spend beyond Google and Meta yields substantial returns. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) improved by as much as 214% (Day 30) for consumer mobile app marketers who diversified their media mix to include channels outside Google and Meta.\n- Mobile app growth is slowing in mature markets but accelerating in emerging new ones. As usage plateaus in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, time spent on mobile apps is rising sharply in South Africa, India, and the Philippines, reflecting a broader shift toward sustainable growth that requires reaching users across a diverse range of apps.\n- User attention is shifting beyond social media and entertainment apps in the US, UK, and India. Time spent is slowing in those categories while casual gaming, productivity, and generative AI apps grow faster\u00e2and over half of users, including nearly two-thirds of 18 to 34 year olds, say they want to cut back on social media.**\n- Independent apps potentially*** reach as many users as TikTok and Instagram combined. With over two billion daily active users (DAU), the independent app ecosystem delivers the same level of reach and user engagement as TikTok and Instagram combined.\n- Diverse inventory is key to driving performance. High-value users are scattered across thousands of apps, making broad reach essential for maximizing every conversion opportunity.\n\u00e2Since expanding our channels beyond social partners, we\u00e2ve seen an increase in platform bookings that we have been able to validate through incrementality modeling,\u00e2 said Valerie Castro, Acquisition Marketing Director at Turo, a popular mobile app marketplace for car rentals. \u00e2We\u00e2re excited to push performance further by increasing our creative velocity.\u00e2\nMethodology\nThis research is based on data from Moloco, Sensor Tower, and Singular, with all sources cited contextually throughout the full report and all data is anonymized and aggregated. Results by category and market meet robust thresholds: more than 30 \u00e2\u00afapps and over $50,000 in ad spend or revenue. The report covers countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam within the timeframe of January-December 2024. The research data set included:\n- Moloco\u00e2s internal forecasts on global mobile user acquisition spend across channels.\n- Singular\u00e2s meta-analysis of over $5 billion in ad spend and 2,000 gaming and consumer apps, comparing spend on mostly Google and Meta vs. diversified spend across both major platforms and the independent app ecosystem.\n- Sensor Tower\u00e2s Mobile App Insights and Audiences Insights for country-level and audience-level time spent insights and leading ad platform trends related to daily active users (DAU).\n*The independent app ecosystem refers to the millions of diverse mobile apps that are developed, published, and monetized by independent companies rather than by the"

      "content": "Streaming has officially taken over the living room, and advertisers are racing to claim their share of attention. Connected TV isn\u00e2t just an alternative to mobile anymore, it\u00e2s shaping up to be one of the most efficient performance channels of 2025. What strategies are essential to drive meaningful results with CTV?\nFor the third installment of Airbridge\u00e2s CTV Insights series, we sat down with Moloco, the AI-powered performance advertising platform fueling growth for businesses of all sizes and industries. As CTV rises as a key driver of successful mobile app marketing, Hyejeong Lee, Head of CTV Partnerships at Moloco, shared must-know insights on how to turn CTV into real performance. Let\u00e2s dive in.\nWith global streaming adoption on the rise and more success stories emerging, the CTV ad market is experiencing steep growth in 2025.\nUser attention is shifting rapidly to CTV. YouTube\u00e2s CTV viewership has already surpassed mobile, underscoring this trend. The main benefits of CTV as a channel include:\nGaming apps, especially mid-core, casino, and sports betting, show particularly strong results. Apps with streaming, short-form video, e-commerce, or web conversion goals (like site visits and pre-registrations) are also gaining traction.\nIn general, apps that already perform well on mobile programmatic channels tend to adapt quickly and succeed with CTV advertising.\nMoloco CTV is built on their deep learning engine, enabling optimization beyond exposure and reach toward down-funnel performance metrics such as installs, in-app actions, purchases, and revenue. Marketers can also carry over insights and targeting strategies from mobile campaigns directly into CTV, driving greater efficiency across both UA and re-engagement.\nMoloco\u00e2s machine learning engine dynamically adjusts bids based on an advertiser\u00e2s KPIs to maximize performance.\nCurrently, they offer an app install optimization model, with the ability to optimize funnel KPIs such as in-app actions, purchases, and ROAS. They are also expanding to optimization for purchases and ROAS in the near future.\nThanks to their integration with Airbridge, advertisers can leverage postbacks in CTV, unlocking performance optimization at the same level as mobile DSPs. This makes it possible not only for mobile apps but also for today\u00e2s rising PC and console game publishers to run install-based campaigns with true performance goals. Few solutions currently provide this level of deep funnel optimization.\nMost of the strong results come from in-stream video ads within AVOD, FAST, and live TV content. These formats are non-skippable, with completion rates as high as 93\u00e296%.\nYouTube\u00e2s CTV viewership has already surpassed mobile, making CTV a must-consider channel for digital marketers.\nCompared to mobile and web, CTV ads deliver higher immersion and lighter ad load. Unlike linear TV, they also support real-time optimization and creative A/B testing. Campaigns can run flexibly with reasonable budgets, without the need for long-term upfront commitments. Advertisers can upload video assets directly on the Moloco platform and track performance through MMP integrations.\nMoloco offers a wide range of targeting features, including:\nAs the Moloco Household Identity Graph continues to evolve, cross-device and cross-platform optimization will only become more powerful.\nThrough integration with Airbridge, advertisers can measure CTV-driven installs, in-app actions, and lower-funnel KPIs within a unified attribution framework.\nThey can also leverage features like incrementality testing and ghost bidding to analyze CTV\u00e2s contribution to marketing performance with precision.\nTogether with Airbridge, they are building a high-performance CTV advertising ecosystem.\nMany advertisers are building new success stories through Moloco CTV.\u00c2\nFor instance, Krafton leveraged Moloco CTV to support the launch of \u00e2Cookie Run India\u00e2 in the Indian market. They used CTV for upper- and mid-funnel reach, while mobile DSPs captured lower-funnel conversions, driving significant growth.\u00c2\nA leading sports betting app achieved strong results with geo-targeted campaigns and CTV\u00e2s clean ad environment. During a major sports season, they achieved strong conversion efficiency, demonstrating how scalable and performance-driven CTV has become.\nA leading Chinese game publisher also ran UA campaigns for PC/console titles with Moloco CTV, reaching high-value users at highly efficient costs.\nStart by extending the audiences that already perform well on mobile DSPs into CTV. In premium environments like the living room, you\u00e2ll gain higher attention and stronger engagement.\nDon\u00e2t stop at awareness, but rather optimize for lower-funnel outcomes such as installs, in-app actions, and purchases\u00c2\nIt\u00e2s also critical to integrate with an MMP like Airbridge to accurately track CTV\u00e2s contribution.\u00c2\nAbove all, don\u00e2t treat CTV as a \u00e2branding-only\u00e2 channel. See it as a natural extension of your mobile UA strategy.\nPC and console platforms "
