# Case File: Aon's Fully Remote Financial Close with Workday

## Executive Summary

Aon successfully implemented a fully remote financial close process across 120 countries using Workday as their single financial management system. According to statements from Aon's CFO, this approach enabled the organization to manage their financial close operations remotely while avoiding the complexity that would have resulted from managing multiple disparate systems. The implementation demonstrates how enterprise organizations can leverage unified financial platforms to maintain operational continuity across global operations, particularly in remote work environments.

## Detailed Findings

### Claim C1: System Consolidation Benefits
**Status: NEEDS REVIEW**

**Claim:** Aon avoided the complexity and challenges of managing financial close across multiple systems by using a single system

**Supporting Quote:** "Doing a close in 10 or 15 different systems would have been a real challenge."

**Analysis:** While the quote clearly indicates that managing financial close across multiple systems (10-15 systems) would present significant challenges, it does not explicitly confirm that Aon actually avoided this complexity or that they successfully implemented a single system solution. The statement acknowledges the potential difficulty but requires additional verification to confirm the actual implementation and benefits achieved.

### Claim C2: Global Remote Financial Close Achievement
**Status: APPROVED**

**Claim:** Aon achieved a fully remote financial close across 120 countries using a single system

**Supporting Quote:** "Aon's CFO shares how the organization achieved a fully remote financial close across 120 countries with a single system"

**Analysis:** This claim is well-supported by the source material. The quote directly confirms all key elements: the achievement of a fully remote financial close, the global scope covering 120 countries, and the use of a single system. The attribution to Aon's CFO adds credibility to the statement.

### Claim C3: Smooth Remote Operations
**Status: APPROVED**

**Claim:** Aon managed a smooth, fully remote financial close across 120 countries

**Supporting Quote:** "Find out how Aon managed a smooth, fully remote financial close across 120 countries"
