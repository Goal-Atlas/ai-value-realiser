      "content": "\"We know that music is an integral part of training for runners and can provide the inspiration and focus they need to take their workouts to the next level. That's why we've developed products that are easy to use together and also provide a premium run experience that naturally integrate sound and data,\" said Jim Mollica, SVP Global Consumer Engagement and Digital at Under Armour.\nThe ecosystem was designed to take every day running essentials - shoes, watch, music - and connect them seamlessly. While running, the UA MapMyRun app can be used to provide real-time coaching and feedback for runners. The addition of UA HOVR Connected footwear gives runners an in-depth analysis of their running form and advanced running metrics to monitor their performance. Now, with support for direct pairing of UA HOVR Connected to MapMyRun app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch, runners are free to leave their phone behind. Finally, the UA True Wireless Flash headphones seamlessly connect to your phone for music powered by JBL Charged Sound, with the option to relay audio coaching feedback directly in the ear.\nIn 2019, Under Armour is committed to helping runners reach their goals by developing cutting-edge products to enhance the running experience. UA has partnered with JBL, an expert in the field of sound and music, to develop new wireless headphones designed for the runner\u2019s unique needs. UA has also updated the MapMyRun App for Samsung\u2019s premium smartwatch, offering runners real-time data to improve their performance.\nThe system is composed of four separate components, each offering their own unique function \u2013 the current and next generation of UA HOVR Connected running shoes, the UA MapMyRun app, the Samsung Galaxy Watch, and UA True Wireless FLASH headphones, engineered by JBL \u2013 items runners already reach for on a daily basis. With Under Armour, these products not only easily connect, but seamlessly work together to provide runners with the data and feedback they need to enhance their performance.\n\"Under Armour is excited to continue elevating our partnerships with world-class technology and experience experts Samsung and JBL, with the introduction of a new seamless ecosystem designed for the runner, by the runner.\"\nJim Mollica, SVP Global Consumer Engagement and Digital at Under Armour.\nUA HOVR CONNECTED FOOTWEAR + MAPMYRUN\nA key component of the runner\u2019s ecosystem is the UA HOVR suite of run footwear, designed for different types of runners with different needs, which all are wirelessly connected to give users access to a wealth of data in the MapMyRun app.\n\u201cThe new MapMyRun technology in all connected HOVR shoes is shown to actually help runners get better,\" said Ben McAllister, Director of Connected Fitness at Under Armour. \"Using data like pace, cadence, stride length and more, the MapMyRun app now offers a personalized coaching experience for each runner, meaning users are motivated to log more workouts and get faster.\u201d\nUA TRUE WIRELESS FLASH ENGINEERED BY JBL\nThe UA True Wireless Flash is designed specifically for running. Featuring Storm Proof waterproof protection, JBL Charged Sound, Comfortable and Secure Flex Fit Sport ear tips, and Bionic Hearing with Ambient Aware for outdoor safety and awareness, this lightweight fully cord-free headphone eliminates distractions so you can focus on your run. In addition to music, the headphones can also be used to relay audio coaching feedback from MapMyRun directly to the runner. A 12-month MapMyRun Premium subscription is included with the purchase of UA True Wireless Flash headphones.\n\u201cAthletes looking for a durable wireless headphone that can stand up to the toughest workout and still sound amazing will love the new UA True Wireless FLASH,\u201d said Michael Mauser, President, Lifestyle Audio at HARMAN. \u201cThe UA True Wireless FLASH will inspire listeners to reach their peak performance without the hassle of wires and cords.\u201d\nSAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH WITH MAPMYRUN + HOVR CONNECTED\nThe UA MapMyRun app on the Galaxy Watch, Samsung\u2019s flagship smartwatch, now directly connects with the UA HOVR Sonic and UA HOVR Phantom. Beginning in February, the Samsung Galaxy Watch will also connect with all new UA HOVR footwear to provide real-time running feedback and post-run form analysis and coaching. After an initial set-up to your phone, UA HOVR Connected shoes automatically pair to the UA MapMyRun app on the Galaxy Watch, with no set-up required. Now, runners can run free from their phone, but still receive real-time feedback on cadence, stride length, distance, pace and more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great time to grow our partnership with Under Armour, a leading performance company, especially as consumers continue to rely on technology to take their health and fitness to the next level.

      "content": "What do you think is the best way to understand business ecosystems?\u00c2\nI think the best way is to examine the ecosystem activities of companies. For this reason, today we will look at another example and will have a look at Under Armour.\nUnder Armour is an American sporting goods brand headquartered in Baltimore. Originally developed as a brand for martial arts clothing and thermal sports underwear and jerseys in sports such as baseball and basketball, Under Armour now also offers products such as leisure T-shirts, pants, shoes and caps.\nLet's take a look at Under Armour with the help of the Ecosystem Strategy Map: Under Armour\u00e2s portfolio covers the Life Areas of Consumption, Work, Entertainment, Socialize, Health, Recreation and Education.\n\u00e2\n\u00e2\nLet's go through each section of the Ecosystem Strategy Map:\nConsumption\nUnder Armour's main source of revenue is generated from their Direct-to-customer (DTC) and retail business of sports clothing, shoes and hardware.This includes e-commerce via the Under Armour app and physical stores. In return, the Under Armour app provides first-party data as feedback for Under Armour.\nPartnerships with strategic wholesale partners contribute to the ecosystem by enabling long-term growth and a larger distribution footprint. Under Armour\u00e2s merchandise is sold in a number of U.S. department stores, specialty sporting goods stores and off-price retail locations, in addition to mom-and-pop businesses.\nThe Under Armour membership program offers rewards such as new gear or exclusive experiences for athletes, as well as a membership card. Members can sign up for free and earn points for their gear and workouts. They also have access to exclusive member perks such as special events, early access to select gear and promotions, training tips from experts, and birthday rewards. Points can be earned by purchasing equipment or completing qualifying fitness challenges on UA MapMyRun. These kinds of membership programs create continual touchpoints and incentives and finally lock-in effects to remain in the ecosystem.\u00c2\n\u00e2Collaborations with premium brands like Palm Angels and celebrities such as actor Dwaine Johnson and basketball player Stephen Curry offer hype products in special collections.\u00c2\nUnder Armour's Affiliate Program offers participants a commission for every click made on approved websites.\nRecreation and Health\u00c2\nIn partnership with FX Fitness, Under Armour offers Performance Centers. These are branded, state-of-the-art gyms that offer a variety of services such as personal training, group training and performance training in addition to regular fitness operations. They also include additional services such as hairdressing, physical therapy, spa and wellness centers. These offerings extend the user experience from the product to services and also create further lock-in effects.\u00c2\nUnder Armour also offers apps like MapMyRun and MapMyFitness. They help athletes track their progress, improve performance and celebrate success together. MapMyFitness friends can detect peers who are in the same geographic area and will show them on the map while you record an activity, making it possible to share your achievements.\nIn the Life Area health, the range of connected products includes smart footwear such as the UA connected running shoe collection, which records running data and synchronizes it to the MapMyRun and MapMyFitness App. Under Armour also offers wireless headphones designed by JBL that record heart rate during workouts. All these initiatives pay into the ambition to gain relevant user data and find out more about the needs of the customers.\nWork\nEarlier this year, Under Armour announced its exclusive partnership as technical spacewear provider for Virgin Galactic. In that so-called best-in-class partnership Under Armour developed special space suits for Virgin Galactics' space tourists for the first commercial space flight.\nEntertainment\nAR gaming is the integration of visual and audio game content with the user's environment in real time, a trend that Under Armour is also taking advantage of. Developed in collaboration with Snapchat and NFL player Cam Newton, the It Comes From Below game is available to Snapchat users in the U.S. and Canada, who can play by swiping up on ads or on Snapchat Discover.\nPrevious projects have included the Under Armour and U.S. Army All American Football Team VR Experience from 2017.\nFinally, hosting their own sporting events and sponsoring professional athletes and sports clubs helps individuals and companies alike stage major events.\nEducation and Social\nCommunity events such as running groups are supported by UA's International Fellowship. Sports groups connect people and promote engagement.\u00c2\nSeveral partnerships with nonprofit organizations across the U.S. promote engagement and change. For example, Donors Choose empowers public school teachers from across the USA to request much-needed materials for their students, while MENTOR promotes the quality "
