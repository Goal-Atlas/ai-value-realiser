# Case File: Under Armour's Connected Fitness Ecosystem

## Executive Summary

Under Armour transformed from a traditional athletic apparel company into a comprehensive connected fitness ecosystem, launching what they positioned as the world's first Connected Fitness system in 2016. The company built a digital platform encompassing over 160 million community members across multiple fitness applications including UA Record, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, and MyFitnessPal. This ecosystem integrates smart footwear, wearable devices, wireless headphones, and mobile applications to create a seamless connected experience for athletes.

The transformation extends beyond product innovation to include strategic partnerships with technology leaders like HTC, Samsung, and JBL, creating an open API platform with over 400 partner integrations. Under Armour's approach combines hardware, software, services, and community to create multiple touchpoints and lock-in effects, positioning the company as a comprehensive fitness technology provider rather than just an apparel manufacturer.
