All claims describe operational improvements, efficiency gains, and process optimization within Publicis's existing integrated marketing services business model.

This should be evaluated as tier 1 - Publicis is using AI to do their existing work better/faster/cheaper, not to create fundamentally new ways of creating value. The 'remove the AI' test confirms this: without AI, Publicis would still be a marketing services company, just less efficient."
