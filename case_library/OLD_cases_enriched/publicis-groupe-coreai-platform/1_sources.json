      "content": "Dive Brief:\n- Publicis Groupe will invest 300 million euros (about $325 million) over the next three years to better position its business around generative artificial intelligence (AI), one of the most significant agency bets on the technology to date, according to a press release.\n- The investment will support an in-house platform called CoreAI that draws on troves of Publicis data, including 2.3 billion consumer profiles. CoreAI will aid in five service areas: insights, media, creative and production, software and operations.\n- The first 100 million euro tranche will be deployed in 2024, with half used for upskilling and hiring and half intended for technology licensing, cloud infrastructure and software. Publicis enacting the latest chapter in its transformation comes as the network reported organic revenue growth of 6.3% in 2023, above prior guidance.\nDive Insight:\nAfter a year of breathless hype, generative AI\u2019s impact on marketing and advertising is coming into clearer focus. Publicis is experimenting with how the fast-emerging technology could reshape large parts of its marketing services behemoth, raising the stakes for rivals that have lagged on the performance front. In the announcement, executives positioned the move as yet another reinvention, with the goal of making Publicis \u201cthe industry\u2019s first AI-powered Intelligent System.\u201d\n\u201cBecoming an intelligent system will allow us, thanks to AI, to connect all of our enterprise knowledge,\u201d said CEO Arthur Sadoun during a presentation to investors and the press. \u201cEach individual within the group will have access to everything we know at Publicis, at every expertise and every geography \u2026 We are bringing together all of the data within each and every aspect of the group under one single entity.\u201d\nPublicis bills CoreAI, which started development last year, as the next step of a strategy that has seen the firm sometimes painfully try to distance itself from the cumbersome structures and stodginess associated with traditional agency networks. The journey to turning into a \u201cplatform\u201d company has involved bigger bets on data, including a whopper deal for Epsilon in 2019 (a heftier investment than CoreAI by several orders of magnitude); shifting to a country-based model; and streamlining its operational backbone, including through an AI assistant named Marcel that debuted in 2018.\nMarcel, the target of some mockery at launch, has seemed to be vindicated in the long run. Rivals are now racing to improve their AI know-how and services, while many in the industry are anxious to see how much of their work will be eliminated by automation. WPP last year struck a pact with Nvidia around the development of an AI-powered content engine and others, like Dentsu, have recently ramped up their bets in the sector.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think AI will ever replace great creative minds,\u201d said Sadoun during the presentation. \u201cHaving said that, there is no doubt that generative AI will help us push the boundaries of creativity even further.\u201d\nPublicis is promoting CoreAI as more sophisticated than rival offerings thanks to the strengths of the agency\u2019s data sets. The group\u2019s $4 billion purchase of Epsilon is another decision that initially invited skepticism but has helped Publicis drive growth as client demands for data-driven expertise mount amid the death of the cookie and other signal loss. Publicis\u2019 data and tech segment accounted for a third of net revenue in Q4, with Epsilon experiencing double-digit growth over the period.\nCoreAI will be trained on data from Epsilon, Publicis Sapient, CitrusAd, Profitero and Marcel. In total, the software has access to 2.3 billion consumer profiles and hundreds of thousands of attributes about those people, along with a window into some 650 impression bids that are made daily.\n\u201cBecause we own this data, we have the clearest line of sight into the thousands attributes that describe these people,\u201d said Sam Levine Archer, chief solutions officer at Publicis North America, drawing constrast with competitors who license their data.\nAI\u2019s threat to jobs and associated ethical concerns were addressed by Publicis leadership, who emphasized that they want to use the tech as an \u201copportunity for our people to grow.\u201d Still, CoreAI\u2019s applications are wide-ranging and it\u2019s easy to imagine them disrupting some roles over the long term. Engineers currently account for roughly 40% of the agency\u2019s workforce, executives stated.\nIn an example use case described during the presentation, an automaker is under pressure to sell 40,000 electric SUVs in a short time frame. A Publicis employee uses CoreAI\u2019s insights function to digest the client brief quickly and extrapolate key data points, massively improving efficiency.\n\u201cInstead of having teams of data scientists working to clean and then to harmonize and then to analyze the data over the course of weeks, our strategists immediately respond with clear analysis of the opportunity,\u201d said Archer.\nA media planner then queries the"

At the heart of this strategic pivot is CoreAI, an in-house platform designed to leverage Publicis\u2019 extensive data, including 2.3 billion consumer profiles, for insights across media planning, creative endeavors, and software operations.\nKey Takeaways\n- Publicis Groupe commits \u20ac300 million to generative AI, focusing on the CoreAI platform.\n- CoreAI to enhance efficiency, innovation, and personalized marketing solutions.\n- Publicis envisions becoming an \u201cintelligent system\u201d for seamless knowledge and data utilization across the group.\n- Strategic acquisitions, such as Epsilon, play a critical role in Publicis\u2019 data-driven marketing leadership.\nApproach\nRecognizing the transformative potential of generative AI, Publicis embarked on integrating this technology to enrich its marketing and advertising solutions. The approach was centered around CoreAI, aiming to connect the agency\u2019s vast knowledge and data, thus fostering innovation and collaboration across the organization.\nImplementation\nThe rollout of Publicis Groupe\u2019s CoreAI marked a significant milestone in the company\u2019s implementation of its AI strategy. The phased approach began with alpha testing to ensure the platform\u2019s functionality met the high standards required for broad organizational adoption. Early access was granted to select teams for real-world testing and feedback, which was critical for refining and optimizing the platform. This methodical progression was aimed at ensuring CoreAI\u2019s integration would be seamless and effective, aligning with Publicis\u2019 vision of becoming an intelligent system. Furthermore, the initiative included the strategic use of existing tools like Marcel and Bodhi, leveraging their capabilities to complement the new AI framework.\nPublicis Groupe\u2019s ambitious AI journey also entailed a substantial financial investment focused on both technology and people. The first phase of funding was meticulously planned to balance tech development with workforce enhancement, demonstrating the company\u2019s commitment to fostering a symbiotic relationship between human creativity and AI\u2019s analytical power. This investment was not merely about acquiring cutting-edge technology but also about upskilling Publicis\u2019 global workforce. The company embarked on comprehensive training programs to ensure that its employees, across various disciplines, could effectively use CoreAI to enhance their work, thereby maintaining Publicis\u2019 competitive edge in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\nThe implementation strategy was underpinned by a robust infrastructure designed to support the vast data requirements of CoreAI. Publicis leveraged its rich data resources, significantly bolstered by the acquisition of Epsilon, to feed into CoreAI\u2019s advanced analytics, enabling more precise and personalized marketing solutions. This deep pool of consumer profiles and attributes became a cornerstone for generating insights that drive creativity and effectiveness in marketing campaigns. The integration of CoreAI across Publicis\u2019 global operations was envisioned as a transformational step, not just in how the company operates internally, but also in how it delivers value to clients, setting a new benchmark for innovation in the advertising industry.\nResults\nAlthough early in its journey, Publicis\u2019 AI strategy has already showcased promising outcomes. The group reported a 6.3% organic growth in 2023, surpassing industry averages and attributing this success partly to its digital and AI-driven initiatives. CoreAI has demonstrated potential in streamlining operations, enhancing creative processes, and delivering personalized marketing at scale.\nChallenges and Barriers\nAdapting to generative AI involves navigating complexities around data privacy, ethics, and the risk of job displacement due to automation. Publicis is addressing these concerns by investing in employee upskilling and establishing robust privacy and ethical standards for AI use. Furthermore, the continuous evolution of AI technology presents both a challenge and an opportunity for keeping pace with innovation.\nFuture Outlook\nPublicis Groupe\u2019s AI transformation signifies a shift towards a more interconnected, efficient, and innovative operational model. As the company continues to refine CoreAI and expand its AI capabilities, it aims to redefine the boundaries of creativity and effectiveness in advertising. The focus remains on leveraging AI to enhance client outcomes while upholding ethical standards and fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.\nTo get the latest AI case studies straight to your inbox, subscribe to AI in Action by AIX \u2014 your weekly newsletter dedicated to the exploration of AI impleme"
