      "content": "New agreements announced this week highlight its attractiveness for the aviation sector\nWith the announcement of two key agreements earlier this week, Airbus further underscored the success of its Skywise digital aviation data platform \u2013 which aims to become the single platform of reference used by all major aviation players to improve operational performance and business results.\nLaunched last year in collaboration with Palantir Technologies, Skywise provides users with a single access point to their enriched data by bringing together aviation information from multiple sources into one secure, cloud-based platform physically hosted in Europe.\nThe first agreement announced this week, signed by Airbus and FPT Software, will strengthen development of the Skywise ecosystem in Asia and includes an ambitious training programme for both third-party users and software developers.\neasyJet opts for Skywise\nThe agreement with FPT Software was made public the same day as Airbus\u2019 new five-year pact with British operator easyJet to provide predictive maintenance services for its entire fleet of nearly 300 aircraft, using technology that relies on Skywise. This activity builds on extensive trials with the platform that allowed easyJet engineers to remove components before faults occurred, limiting delays and cancellations as a result.\nSkywise is able to analyse data from other components on easyJet\u2019s aircraft thanks to the installation of Airbus\u2019 new flight operations and maintenance exchanger, called FOMAX \u2013 which collects 60-times more data than existing systems. The new equipment will be fitted on easyJet\u2019s fleet by summer 2019.\nThe more data that is shared with Skywise, the more accurate its predictions and models will be for all users. Deliverables are tailored for each user and include scalable services (such as analytics, apps and APIs) that can be used by Airbus, customers, and suppliers \u2013 ensuring complete data continuity with benefits across the entire value chain.\n- For more details on Airbus\u2019 new agreement with easyJet, read the press release."

      "content": "Log-in here if you\u2019re already a subscriber\nAir safety reporting by The Air Current is provided without a subscription as a public service. Please subscribe to gain full access to all our scoops, in-depth reporting and analyses.\nOn Aug. 17, 2022, after a large Airbus A330neo carrier reported leaking high-pressure valves in the system that bleeds air off of the engines, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to operators of the widebody aircraft. Effective immediately, it prohibited flight crews from taking off in certain configurations, namely with air conditioning packs off, auxiliary power unit (APU) bleed air on, and/or engine bleed air off \u2014 configurations that some but not all A330neo operators were using to achieve higher performance on take-off.\nEmergency ADs are relatively infrequent: EASA typically issues one to two dozen per year across all aircraft types, compared to 400 to 500 normal ADs. They are issued when an unsafe condition exists that requires immediate action. In this case, the emergency AD, which was adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration a day later, stated that leaking bleed system high-pressure valves could expose the downstream pressure regulating valve to damaging high pressure. Failure of the pressure regulating valve, it said, could lead to high pressure and temperatures in the downstream duct, potentially causing the duct to burst and leading to a loss of control of the airplane.\nADs tell operators what to do but they don\u2019t always connect the dots, and neither the emergency AD nor the various ADs that superseded it explained the connection between taking off with \u201cPACKS OFF\u201d, \u201cAPU bleed ON\u201d or \u201cENG bleed OFF\u201d and leaking high-pressure valves. In fact, what the leaking valves had done was trigger a safety investigation within Airbus that discovered a hidden and potentially catastrophic flaw in the A330neo\u2019s pneumatic system \u2014 the details of which have not been previously reported.\nSeeking an explanation for the leaking valves, Airbus engineers turned to the company\u2019s big data platform, Skywise, in search of clues. By comparing operational and sensor data, they were ultimately able to determine that in certain take-off configurations, the software in the bleed monitoring computer (BMC) \u2014 which controls the hot, high-pressure bleed air coming off the aircraft\u2019s Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines \u2014 did not correctly control the high-pressure valve where it meters air from the engine\u2019s high-pressure port. Excessive stress caused a failure of the valve\u2019s clamping pin (or clip), leading to damage of the seal and subsequent leakage, which had the potential through a cascading failure sequence to result in this hot, high-pressure air escaping into the wing and causing major damage.\nAs soon as the issue was understood, Airbus informed EASA and recommended the emergency AD, choosing to accept any resulting operational disruptions rather than risk the possibility of a catastrophic accident while acting on a longer timescale. As additional fixes were developed, subsequent ADs over the next two years directed operators to replace the affected clips and eventually update the BMC software to correct its logic, which ultimately allowed for the initial operating and maintenance restrictions to be relaxed.\nHistorically, hidden failures like this one have been discovered primarily through the investigations that follow in the wake of serious incidents or accidents (the best-known example being the twin crashes in 2018 and 2019 of the Boeing 737 Max). What makes the A330neo case so significant for the entire aviation industry \u2014 including new entrants who are designing highly digital aircraft \u2014 is how data was used to uncover the failure before it resulted in harm to people or property.\nAfter The Air Current approached Airbus with questions about the engineering investigation, the company made Ian Goodwin, director of flight safety \u2013 safety enhancement for Airbus Product Safety, available to discuss both the A330neo case and the company\u2019s approach to leveraging data for safety more broadly.\nThe modern approach to designing and certifying aircraft requires engineers to predict the various ways in which their design might fail, estimate the likelihood of those failures and then implement mitigations for any unacceptable risks. Yet, as aircraft have become ever more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for design engineers and certification authorities to foresee all possible failures of a design across the full range of operating conditions it will encounter in the real world.\nWith Skywise \u2014 a product known best as a tool aimed at increasing operating efficiency for airlines and manufacturing efficiency for the plane maker \u2014 Airbus is demonstrating how its massive trove of data can help build a safety bridge between design and operations, yielding insights that support established processes for ensuring continued airworthiness.\n\u201cEverybody"

      "content": "Challenge\nEmbracing digital transformation to meet massive growth\nAirbus\u2019 design, quality, performance, safety, and comfort set the standards for aviation. With about 25,000 daily flights, Airbus aircraft are taking off or landing every 1.4 seconds. To meet the needs of the growing aviation industry \u2014 expected to double customers in the next 15 years \u2014 Airbus needed to significantly ramp up aircraft production while decreasing costs and improving efficiency in a sustainable way. Since the company's legacy systems could not support this massive growth, Airbus needed to revolutionize its approach to IT \u2014 transforming this manufacturing company into a technology company.\nObjectives\nRethinking IT to transform the business\nAirbus required a complete overhaul of its IT strategy, including:\n- Implementing an enterprise-grade API platform to enable digital transformation at scale\n- Building a library of reusable APIs to speed up development time\n- Leveraging APIs to unlock data in backend systems and expose to suppliers, employees, and internal and external stakeholders\n- Streamlining the supply chain to meet growing production pressures\n- Delivering self-service mobile applications to improve manufacturing team efficiency\nSolution\nUnlocking the power of data with APIs\nAirbus needed to adopt new technologies that would enable the company to be agile and secure, and deliver new solutions to market faster. To meet this goal, Airbus formed a team within the IT department called the \u201cDigital Accelerator,\u201d with the mission to apply digital technologies to transform the way Airbus builds aircraft. One of the Digital Accelerator\u2019s first decisions was to implement Anypoint Platform to drive digital transformation and enable an API-first strategy across the organization.\n\u201cMuleSoft\u2019s Anypoint Platform is one of the Digital Accelerator's critical building blocks,\u201d said Chris Taylor, VP, Digital Accelerator, Airbus. \u201cMuleSoft is an enterprise platform that applies to all our product lines, and is truly global.\u201d\nWith MuleSoft, the team is building a library of reusable APIs which can aggregate data from multiple backend systems and make it accessible and consumable to deliver real business value to multiple stakeholders.\n\u201cAnypoint Platform allows us to rapidly unlock the data in our legacy platforms,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWe can use the data to optimize our manufacturing and supply chain processes, and ultimately optimize our aircraft.\u201d\nThe APIs developed through Anypoint Platform put critical data in the hands of employees on the front lines. Previously, shop floor operators had to rely on physical workstations to access key information about airplane parts, plans, and project status. The constant back-and-forth from workstation to shop floor \u2013 plus the fact that the production team did not have a real-time, consistent view into their projects \u2013 caused significant delays in the manufacturing process.\nUsing MuleSoft, Airbus built an application that shop floor operators can access from their personal mobile devices to gain real-time visibility into parts and projects. Through APIs, Airbus unlocked data from cloud and on-premise systems \u2013 including multiple SAP systems like SAP S/4 HANA and Skywise, a customer big data platform \u2013 bringing this valuable data together to reduce time to market of new aircraft.\n\u201cMuleSoft allows us to give employees on the shop floor direct access to data to make better, faster, educated decisions,\u201d explained Pierre Bornancin, API Team Lead, Airbus, adding that a shop floor operator can scan barcodes on aircraft components and quickly gain access to relevant information\u2013\u2013speeding up the process.\n\u201cWe also use MuleSoft to collect supply chain data and provide real-time visibility to all stakeholders,\u201d Bornancin explained. \u201cBefore MuleSoft, we had no real-time visibility of part status.\u201d\nBy taking an API-led approach, Airbus is reusing the same APIs built for the mobile app to provide data to other stakeholders.\n\u201cWe're providing that very same data to our airline customers,\u201d added Taylor, \u201cso they can develop and deploy applications on top of our open APIs or other open platforms, safely and securely.\u201d\nResults\nDelivering IT projects 4x faster\nWith this new approach to creating a composable enterprise, IT is moving from the back office to driving critical change that will impact the entire business, and ultimately deliver more value.\n\u201cWith fast data access, MuleSoft empowers us to improve how we manufacture aircraft, and how we deliver our customer experience,\u201d Taylor said.\nBy easily developing and reusing APIs through Anypoint Platform, Airbus streamlines the development process and cuts time to market for IT services.\n\u201cAnypoint Platform allows us to reuse APIs at much greater scale across the organization,\u201d Taylor confirmed. \u201cMuleSoft enables our developers to search, discover, amend, develop, and deploy APIs. Having reusable assets and getting the benefits of those assets across the enterprise allows us to d"

      "content": "AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways have become the first airlines to use full aircraft data and advanced predictive analytics on Airbus\u2019 open aviation data platform Skywise, with each signing a premium subscription contract covering Skywise Predictive Maintenance.\nThe agreements cover the retrofit of their respective A320 and A330 Family fleets with FOMAX* \u2013 a new on-board data-capture / transmission module which provides greatly expanded volumes of recorded aircraft data \u2013 only about 400 aircraft parameters could previously be recorded on an A320, compared with roughly 24,000 from an aircraft equipped with it.\nThe sheer quantity of information that Skywise can unlock for each aircraft equipped with the new module will be used by airlines to gain deep insights, create bespoke recommendations and apply state-of-the-art Skywise analytics applications for enhanced decision-making. In turn this will allow them to anticipate, with higher levels of accuracy, the needs for maintenance before an event happens, and thus maximise the operational reliability and utilization of their assets.\nIn addition to the new premium predictive maintenance contracts outlined above, AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways will gain access to Skywise Core, providing them with a cloud-based platform offering unparalleled visibility into their fleet operations.\nAirlines using Skywise Core can integrate their own operational, maintenance, and aircraft data into the Skywise cloud, so they can store, access, manage, and analyse selected Airbus data together with their own data and global benchmarks without the need for additional infrastructure investments. This resulting value will give them new insights at aircraft, fleet, company, and global level while allowing them to enhance their operations through access to OEM expertise and global fleet context.\nFor airlines who have not yet selected the premium predictive services, Airbus offers Skywise Core under a \u201cshared value\u201d arrangement: airlines that agree to share operating data from their Airbus fleet can access the platform at no cost. Airbus has recently signed several agreements with airlines around the world to join Skywise Core, including: Bangkok Airways, LATAM and WOW air. These latest subscribers bring the total number of airlines now connected to the Skywise Core platform to nine \u2013 including previously announced Peach Aviation, easyJet and Emirates.\nMarc Fontaine, Airbus Digital Transformation Officer, commented: \u201cAs the aircraft \u2018architect\u2019 and integrator, we naturally thrive in our role of building digital continuity across the aviation ecosystem. What we are doing now \u2013 bringing together the different actors of the industry, breaking the silos within and outside each organisation \u2013 is a real revolution. I really want to thank our airline customers for their trust, for their forward-thinking approach and for sharing our vision in this adventure. If \u201cinformation is power\u201d, then clearly we are all becoming more powerful, together.\u201d\nLaurent Martinez, Head of Services by Airbus, said: \u201cJust like the industry was disrupted by Airbus\u2019 \u201cFly-by-Wire\u201d concept back in the days, we are now bringing full benefits of \u201cFly-by-Data\u201d to our customers. These deals we are announcing are the result of years of strong co-innovation with our customers, and I am very proud to see that our customers, our reason for being, are confirming the fact that Skywise is meant to become a leading data platform in the industry\u201d.\nSkywise provides all users with one single access point to their enriched data by bringing together to aviation data from multiple sources across the industry into one secure, cloud-based platform physically hosted in Europe. The more data that airlines or OEMs are sharing into the Skywise Core platform, the more accurate the predictions and models for anyone connected. All data is anonymised so knowledge and lessons learnt are shared and data confidentiality is ensured.\nAirbus launched its new aviation data platform Skywise in collaboration with Palantir Technologies \u2013 pioneers in big-data integration and advanced analytics \u2013 during the Paris Air Show in July 2017, after experimenting substantial benefits when applying its technologies to its own internal processes for two years. Skywise aims to become the platform of reference used by all major aviation players to improve their operational performance and business results and to support their own digital transformation. The deliverables will be tailored for each user and will include scalable services (such as analytics, apps and APIs) which can be used by Airbus, customers, and suppliers \u2013 ensuring complete data continuity with benefits across the entire value chain.\nAbout Airbus\nAirbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services.
