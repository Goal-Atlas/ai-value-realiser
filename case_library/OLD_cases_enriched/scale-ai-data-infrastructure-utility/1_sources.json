      "content": "Scale AI: Why Data Will Power the AI Revolution\nScale AI emerged from a fairly small-stakes problem. Alexandr Wang, its 26-year-old founder and CEO, wanted to know when to restock his fridge.\nWang grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the son of two physicists working at the national lab in town. That upbringing helped spark his interest in science and technology. In high school, he excelled in math, physics, and coding competitions, and worked for two tech companies. In 2015, he enrolled at MIT to study computer science, where he received perfect grades in his first year. But he had that grocery problem. He decided to code his way out of it.\nWang could see that artificial intelligence and machine learning were transforming the world. \u201cFirst we built machines that could do arithmetic,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.\u201d He looked around for a side project and decided to build a camera inside his fridge that would tell him if he was running low on milk.\nAfter a few weeks, he realized there was no way he\u2019d get enough data to train his system to properly quantify his fridge\u2019s contents. A realization struck him. He envisioned AI over the next 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build incredible things with AI,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the hurdles? It became really clear that data was going to be one of those.\u201d That\u2019s when he came up with Scale, what he calls \u201cdata infrastructure to power the AI revolution.\u201d\n\"First we built machines that could do arithmetic, but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.\"\n\u2014 Alex Wang, Scale AI\nWang dropped out of MIT after a year and joined the tech accelerator Y Combinator with a small team. They couldn\u2019t power the AI revolution singlehandedly, so they narrowed their efforts to a use case that had captured the world\u2019s attention: autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars need to learn to recognize pedestrians, stop lights, other cars, and more. They can\u2019t do it on their own; they need humans to label images for them so they can learn by example. Scale recruited humans to do the labeling for car companies, so the companies could train their AI on those images.\nTo build their business, Scale needed to get in front of clients\u2019 faces. So they traveled to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), a big AI conference. \u201cWe would be super scrappy,\u201d Wang says. \u201cWe\u2019d go from booth to booth with a laptop with a demo on it.\u201d The gambit worked. \u201cAnd then as we grew, it became more applicable to other industries of AI, whether that\u2019s for satellite data, or e-commerce data, or large internet companies, or insurance companies, or U.S. government organizations.\u201d\nZhichun Li, one of Scale\u2019s first employees, recalls a big client meeting in the South Bay. She and two other employees were all young, like Wang, and wore backpacks. Someone commented that it looked like a field trip. \u201cIt was just funny how you bring in a small group of very young, talented people and hand them this problem,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just going to solve it.\u201d\nRapid Iteration\nOne of Scale\u2019s most popular solutions to data-labeling is a service called Rapid, which was spearheaded by Li. Imagine you\u2019re a customer. You go to the site and click \u201cLabel My Data.\u201d You can start with a template, or create your own, then upload data, whether it\u2019s images, video, audio or spreadsheets. You upload instructions for labeling and create a calibration batch. Within a few hours, the batch is completed and you receive feedback noting anything unclear in the instructions. You can iterate until you work out all the kinks. Then the rest of your data is free to be labeled.\nScale Rapid is self-serve, on-demand labeling to train AI with high-quality ground-truth data and enables machine-learning engineers and researchers to receive labels and instruction feedback in a matter of hours and scale to production volumes in days. Rapid integrates with Scale\u2019s ecosystem of products to add data into existing ML data pipelines. Customers benefit from the company\u2019s ML expertise and infrastructure, as well as its human-in-the-loop network.\nNow, \u201cany ML engineer in the world can access it and get high-quality data back quickly,\u201d Li says. While \u201cScale is getting people the data that they need to train the models,\u201d she notes, \u201cit is also accelerating and shortening the experimentation loops that they need to get to the perfect model.\u201d\n\"Scale is getting people the data that they need to train the models.

      "content": "Thesis\nIt has been over ten years since Marc Andreessen\u2019s famous pronouncement that software was eating the world. From shopping and entertainment to healthcare and education, software has become a key component of nearly every aspect of life. Since the AI Boom in the late 2010s, however, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been eating software. Examples of this include Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, Waymo\u2019s driverless taxis, GitHub Copilot, TikTok content recommendations, or on-the-fly context-aware automated website guides like Ramp\u2019s AI tour guide. The models that have enabled these advancements have required increased volumes of data for training. As Clive Humby pointed out in 2006, \u201cData is the new oil.\u201d\nOne meaningful benefit of building AI applications has been the dramatic increase in the volume of data generated from both the digital and physical world. Through advances like computer vision, sensor fusion, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, the volume of physical data has increased significantly. However, in order to train models with these types of resources, the data needs to not just be available, but be organized.\nA persistent issue with building AI/ML applications has been the lack of well-organized data necessary for developing models. This is a self-reinforcing cycle where initial data collection leads to improved AI models, enhancing user experience. Better user experiences attract more users, leading to further data collection. Over time, this cycle continually upgrades the quality of the AI model and the user experience. Data scarcity extends the timelines required to build AI models and reduces their accuracy. Without a strong dataset to train AI models, applications can exhibit decreased capabilities and increased vulnerabilities. Moreover, a lack of data can often prevent the application from being developed altogether. For example, in medical research, the limited availability of data for diagnosing rare diseases and conditions makes building an accurate AI application for identifying such conditions challenging and often unreliable.\nThat\u2019s where Scale AI comes in. Scale AI\u2019s vision is to be the foundational infrastructure behind AI/ML applications. The company began with data labeling and annotation used for building AI/ML models, tagging relevant information or metadata in a dataset to use for training an ML model. Scale AI\u2019s core value proposition is built around ensuring companies have correctly labeled data to allow them to build effective ML models. By building comprehensive datasets, Scale AI provides the foundation for building AI/ML applications.\nFounding Story\nScale AI was founded by MIT dropout Alexandr Wang (CEO) and Carnegie Mellon dropout and Thiel fellow Lucy Guo.\nIn 2015, Wang enrolled at MIT to study computer science, where he received perfect grades in his first year. Wang had the insight that artificial intelligence and machine learning were going to transform the world:\n\"First we built machines that could do arithmetic, but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.\"\nTo further explore AI, Wang started out with a fairly small-stakes problem: knowing when to restock his fridge. Obsessed with the grocery problem, Wang decided to build a camera inside his fridge to tell him if he was running low on milk. At this point, he realized that there was not enough data available so that he could train his system to quantify the contents of the fridge properly. He also noticed his peers weren\u2019t building AI products despite their training because there was a lack of well-organized data available for them to develop models. This eventually led to the creation of Scale AI.\nWang extrapolated this problem out to the implications for AI in general, realizing that data would clearly be a meaningful hurdle. In order to bridge the gap between human and machine-learning capabilities, there was a need for accurately labeled datasets that could train AI models.\nDuring this time, Lucy Guo was at Carnegie Mellon, studying computer science and human-computer interactions. In her second year, she applied for the Thiel Fellowship. The program awards $100K to help those motivated enough to build a business, on the condition that they drop out of school. In 2014, her senior year, she dropped out.\nAfter her first company failed due to legal issues surrounding food delivery from non-commercial kitchens, she interned at Facebook and worked as a product designer at Quora and Snapchat. Wang and Guo met working togetther at Quora and concieved the idea for Scale AI shortly thereafter.\nThe Scale AI was accepted into Y-Combinator in 2016 and raised a $120K seed round. After exploring several aspects of the infrastructure needed for AI, the team narrowed its efforts down to autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars needed humans to label the images so that the AI the cars used could be tr"
