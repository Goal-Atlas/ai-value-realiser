# Case File: Roche/Genentech AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery and Target Identification

## Executive Summary

Roche's subsidiary Genentech has embarked on a strategic transformation of drug discovery through artificial intelligence and machine learning, most notably through a multi-year collaboration with NVIDIA announced in November 2023. The initiative centers on their "lab in a loop" approach, which integrates experimental data with AI models to create iterative improvements in drug discovery processes.

The case presents a compelling narrative of AI's potential to address the pharmaceutical industry's fundamental challenges: the traditional drug development process takes 12-15 years, costs over $2 billion per drug, and has a mere 7.9% success rate from Phase I to market approval. Genentech's AI strategy aims to revolutionize this paradigm through enhanced data analysis, predictive modeling, and accelerated virtual molecular testing.

**Key Approved Claims:**
- AI enables more predictable and cost-effective drug development while boosting R&D success rates
- The "lab in a loop" approach streamlines traditional trial-and-error methods and improves model performance
- AI enables rapid generation and testing of thousands of virtual molecular structures
- Traditional drug development costs exceed $2 billion per new drug, with only 7.9% success rate from Phase I to market

**Areas Requiring Further Validation:**
Several claims about "unprecedented scale," "dramatic acceleration," and impact on "millions of patients" lack specific quantitative metrics and require additional evidence for full verification.
