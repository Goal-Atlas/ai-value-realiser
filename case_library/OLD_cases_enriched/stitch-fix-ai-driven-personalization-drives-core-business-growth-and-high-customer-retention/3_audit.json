All claims describe operational improvements, process automation, and performance optimization within Stitch Fix's existing business model (personalized styling subscription boxes). This is clearly a tier 1 case - AI is being used to do the same things better (better personalization, faster ad creation, improved retention) rather than enabling new business models or markets. The 'remove the AI' test confirms this: without AI, Stitch Fix would still be a styling service, just less efficient. This should be reclassified as tier 1."
