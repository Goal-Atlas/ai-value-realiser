# Wendy's QSCC-Palantir Supply Chain Optimization Partnership

## Executive Summary

Wendy's Quality Supply Chain Co-op (QSCC), serving over 6,400 Wendy's restaurants across the United States and Canada, has entered into a strategic partnership with Palantir Technologies to accelerate digital transformation and AI adoption across their supply chain operations. The collaboration focuses on developing an integrated supply chain network through AI-driven automated workflows, creating a connected ecosystem of suppliers, distributors, and restaurants.

The implementation follows a two-phase approach: first transitioning to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for enhanced decision-making capabilities, followed by utilizing AI for supply chain management and waste prevention. The partnership aims to deliver new sales opportunities, operational efficiencies, cost savings, and competitive advantages through advanced AI systems including large language models.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Partnership drives new sales and operating efficiencies providing competitive advantage
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Finding:** QSCC leadership has explicitly stated that the Palantir partnership leverages supply chain ecosystem power to drive new sales and operating efficiencies, positioning Wendy's with a distinct industry advantage. This claim is directly supported by official statements from QSCC President and CEO Pete Suerken.

### C2: AI platform enables improved decision-making speed and scale
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Finding:** The partnership includes a specific transition to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) designed to enhance decision-making speed and scale by connecting disparate data sources. This represents a concrete technological implementation with measurable benefits.

### C3: AI implementation results in cost savings and efficiency improvements across supply chain
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Finding:** The second phase of implementation specifically targets supply chain management and waste prevention through large language models and AI systems, with expected outcomes of cost savings and efficiency improvements across the entire supply chain network.

### C4: AI operating system provides technology-driven competitive advantage
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Finding:** Palantir's global commercial leadership has confirmed that their AI operating system powers leading American companies and provides technology-driven competitive advantages, though this claim is somewhat general in nature.

### C5: AI loyalty platform provides personalized customer rewards and incentives
**Status:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Finding:** While the claim about AI-based loyalty platforms offering personalized rewards is verifiable, this appears to reference a separate March 2023 initiative rather than the Palantir supply chain partnership. The relationship between this customer-facing AI application and the supply chain optimization project requires clarification.

### C6: AI drive-thru system automates ordering process and improves customer interaction
**Status:** NEEDS_REVIEW  
**Finding:** The claim regarding AI drive-thru automation capabilities appears to reference Wendy's separate "FreshAI" partnership with Google from May 2023, not the Palantir supply chain optimization initiative. This represents a different AI implementation focused on customer service rather than supply chain operations.
