# Case File: HELLENiQ ENERGY AI Productivity Transformation

## Executive Summary

HELLENiQ ENERGY, a leading integrated energy group in Southeast Europe, successfully implemented Microsoft 365 Copilot as part of a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. The implementation, supported by PwC Greece, resulted in significant productivity improvements and operational enhancements across the organization.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Over 70% of employees reported enhanced productivity
- Meeting catch-up times improved by 4x
- 71 tailored use cases developed across business functions
- Successful deployment of AI-powered HR assistant "HRaklis"
- Establishment of a community of 600 Digital Stars for adoption support

The transformation focused on three core pillars: continuous innovation, employee-centric design, and operational excellence, with a gradual and personalized onboarding approach that placed people at the center of the strategy.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: Employee Productivity Enhancement (APPROVED)
**Claim:** Over 70% of employees reported enhanced productivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot

**Status:** APPROVED - Specific, measurable claim with direct supporting evidence

**Evidence:** The PwC case study explicitly states that "over 70% of employees reported enhanced productivity" following the Microsoft 365 Copilot rollout. This represents a clear, quantifiable outcome metric that demonstrates the success of the AI implementation.

### C2: Meeting Efficiency Improvement (APPROVED)
**Claim:** Meeting catch-up times improved fourfold with Microsoft 365 Copilot

**Status:** APPROVED - Quantifiable improvement with exact supporting documentation

**Evidence:** The source directly states that "meeting catch-up times improved fourfold," representing a 4x improvement in efficiency for meeting-related processes. This specific metric demonstrates measurable operational enhancement.

### C3: Employee Engagement and Operational Impact (NEEDS REVIEW)
**Claim:** AI adoption brought step change in employee engagement and operational enhancements

**Status:** NEEDS REVIEW - Vague language requires additional verification

**Evidence:** While the quote from Andreas Botsikas (PwC Director) supports the general sentiment about "step change" and "huge advances," the language is subjective and lacks specific metrics. The claim would benefit from more concrete supporting data.

### C4: Use Case Development (APPROVED)
**Claim:** 71 tailored use cases were developed to integrate Copilot into daily workflows across business functions

**Status:** APPROVED - Specific, verifiable implementation detail

**Evidence:** The case study clearly documents that "PwC collaborated with key business functions such as Finance, Operations, Marketing, HR, and Customer Service to develop 71 tailored use cases that integrate Copilot into daily workflows." This represents a comprehensive, measurable implementation scope.

### C5: Productivity Boost Headline Claim (NEEDS REVIEW)
**Claim:** HELLENiQ ENERGY achieved 70% productivity boost with Microsoft 365 Copilot

**Status:** NEEDS REVIEW - Source appears to be headline rather than substantive content

**Evidence:** The 70% figure appears in what seems to be a title or headline format. While consistent with other productivity claims, this specific phrasing requires verification that it represents actual measured productivity improvement rather than marketing language.

## Implementation Details

The transformation was executed through a structured approach:

1. **Initial Rollout:** Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment with early access experimentation
2. **Use Case Development:** 71 tailored applications across Finance, Operations, Marketing, HR, and Customer Service

4. **Support Structure:** 600 Digital Stars community and Digital Heroes support team
