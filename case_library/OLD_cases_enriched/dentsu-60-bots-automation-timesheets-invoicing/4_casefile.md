# Dentsu Automation Case Study

## Executive Summary

Dentsu, a global digital marketing communications company with 45,000 employees across 145 countries, has implemented comprehensive automation initiatives through their Automation Center of Excellence (COE) and Citizen Automation Program (CAP). The company achieved significant operational improvements through RPA deployment and AI integration, including the deployment of 60 robots in 30 days that saved over 125,000 hours, and timesheet automation that reduced processing time from one business day to 10 minutes. Their AI copilot implementation achieved a 90% reduction in time-to-insight for media planning operations.

## Detailed Findings

### C1: 60 Robots Deployment Achievement ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: 60 robots deployed in 30 days saved over 125,000 hours

**Evidence**: The CoE built and deployed an army of 60 robots in just 30 days to complete a large-scale data extraction and migration project, saving more than 125,000 hours.

**Assessment**: Specific metrics with directly supporting documentation. This represents a major automation deployment with quantifiable results.

### C2: Timesheet Processing Automation ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Timesheet reporting automation reduced process time from 1 business day to 10 minutes

**Evidence**: Team members used StudioX to build an automation for a process that required them to download and combine information from different systems into a formatted Microsoft Excel report. This process took each team member one business day to complete; the attended robot they built completes it in just 10 minutes.

**Assessment**: Clear before/after comparison with substantial time savings (98.6% reduction). Well-documented citizen-led automation success.

### C3: Media Operations Team Savings ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Media Operations team automations expected to save 850+ hours annually

**Evidence**: In one hackathon for the Media Operations team, employees built automations that are expected to save the team 850+ hours of manual effort each year.

**Assessment**: Specific projected savings with appropriate qualifier language. Represents significant operational efficiency gains.

### C4: Automation Use Cases ✅ APPROVED
**Claim**: Popular automations included timesheet reporting and invoice processing

**Evidence**: Popular citizen-led automations included preparing and manipulating Microsoft Excel reports, exporting and filing invoices, timesheet reporting and email reminders, as well as downloading, transforming and uploading data across systems.

**Assessment**: Comprehensive list of automation applications with direct supporting documentation.

### C5: AI Copilot Time-to-Insight Reduction ⚠️ NEEDS_REVIEW
**Claim**: AI copilot reduced time-to-insight by 90%

**Evidence**: Dentsu achieved a 90% reduction in time-to-insight, turning weeks of manual analysis into minutes of conversational intelligence.

**Assessment**: Very high percentage claim with supporting quote, but lacks context on baseline measurement methodology. The "weeks to minutes" description suggests the 90% figure could be accurate, but verification of calculation basis would strengthen this claim.

### C6: Campaign Operations Improvements ⚠️ NEEDS_REVIEW
**Claim**: Campaign activation became faster and operational costs dropped

**Evidence**: Campaign activation became faster, operational costs dropped, and planners were freed to focus on strategic work.

**Assessment**: Qualitative improvements without specific metrics. While the direction of improvement is supported, quantifiable evidence would strengthen these claims.
