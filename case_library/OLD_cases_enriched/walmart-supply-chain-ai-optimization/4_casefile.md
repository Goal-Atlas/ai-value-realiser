## Detailed Findings

### APPROVED CLAIMS

**C1: Real-Time Issue Resolution**
- **Claim:** AI enables automatic detection, diagnosis, and correction of supply chain issues in real time without manual intervention
- **Evidence:** Direct quote from Indira Uppuluri, SVP of supply chain technology: "By layering multiple AI and automation technologies, Walmart's systems can 'automatically detect, diagnose, and correct issues in real time without requiring constant manual intervention'"
- **Assessment:** Well-documented capability with executive confirmation

**C2: Forecasting and Inventory Optimization**
- **Claim:** AI-powered forecasting enables more accurate inventory planning and reduces excess safety stock in warehouses

- **Claim:** Walmart's distribution centers achieve 98% automation through AI and robotics
- **Evidence:** James Bright, general manager of Wellford facility: "the distribution center is 98% automated"
- **Assessment:** Specific, quantifiable achievement with facility-level verification

**C6: Cost Reduction Through Inventory Management**
- **Claim:** AI reduces costs by lowering buffer inventory requirements
