# Case File: Upstart's AI-Powered Credit Underwriting and Lending

## Executive Summary

Upstart has transformed the lending industry by replacing traditional credit scoring with AI models that analyze over 1,600 variables to assess creditworthiness. This fundamental shift in underwriting methodology has enabled the company to approve 27% more borrowers than traditional methods while offering interest rates 16% below average, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study. The transformation extends beyond better outcomes to operational excellence, with 91% of loans now fully automated without human intervention.

Since its founding in 2012, Upstart has facilitated nearly $40 billion in loans to over 3 million consumers, demonstrating the scalability of AI-native lending. The company's models separate risk 3-6x better than traditional methods, enabling a fundamentally different value proposition that expands credit access while maintaining profitability. This represents a true business model transformation where AI doesn't just optimize existing processes but creates entirely new market opportunities and competitive advantages.
