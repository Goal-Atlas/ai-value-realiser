      "content": "With two early hits and the promise of more to come, it feels like a whole new ballgame in lending for Grant Schneider.\nThe AI models he helped create as vice president of machine learning for Upstart are approving more personal loans at lower interest rates than the rules traditional banks use to gauge credit worthiness.\nWhat\u2019s more, he\u2019s helping the Silicon Valley startup, now one of the newest public companies in the U.S., pioneer a successful new hub of AI development in Columbus, Ohio.\nA Mentor in the Midwest\nSchneider\u2019s career has ridden an AI rocket courtesy of two simple twists of fate.\n\u201cIn the 2009 downturn, I was about to graduate from Ohio State in finance and there were no finance jobs, but a mentor convinced me to take some classes in statistics,\u201d he said.\nHe wound up getting a minor, a master\u2019s and then a Ph.D. in the field in 2014, just as machine learning was emerging as the hottest thing in computing.\n\u201cThen I read about Upstart in a random news article, sent them a cold email and got a response \u2014 I was blown away by the team,\u201d he said.\nA Breakthrough with Big Data\nSchneider signed on as a data scientist, experimenting with ways to process online loan requests from the company\u2019s website. He trained AI models on publicly available datasets while the startup slowly curated its own private trove of data.\nThe breakthrough came with the first experiment training a model on Upstart\u2019s own data. \u201cOvernight our approval rates nearly doubled \u2026 and over time it became clear we were actually moving the needle in improving access to credit,\u201d he said.\nAs the business grew, Upstart gathered more data. That data helped make models more accurate so it could extend credit to more borrowers at lower rates. And that attracted more business.\nRiding the Virtuous Cycle of AI\nThe startup found itself on a flywheel it calls the virtuous cycle of AI.\n\u201cOne of the coolest parts of working on AI models is they directly drive the interest rates we can offer, so as we get better at modeling we extend access to credit \u2014 that\u2019s a powerful motivator for the team,\u201d he said.\nBorrowers like it, too. More than 620,000 of them were approved by Upstart\u2019s models to get a total $7.8 billion in personal loans so far, about 27 percent more than would\u2019ve been approved by traditional credit models, at interest rates 16 percent below average, according to a study from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nThe figures span all demographic groups, regardless of age, race or ethnicity. \u201cOur AI models are getting closer to the truth of credit worthiness than traditional methods, and that means there should be less bias,\u201d Schneider said.\nBetting on the Buckeyes\nAs it grew, the Silicon Valley company sought a second location where it could expand its R&D team. A study showed the home of Schneider\u2019s alma mater could be a good source of tech talent, so the Ohio State grad boomeranged back to the Midwest.\nColumbus exceeded expectations even for a bullish Schneider. What was going to be a 140-person office in a few years has already hit nearly 250 people primarily in AI, software engineering and operations with plans to double to 500 soon.\n\u201cHaving seen the company when it was 20 people in a room below a dentist\u2019s office, that\u2019s quite a change,\u201d Schneider said.\nGPUs Slash Test Time\nUpstart has experience with nearly a dozen AI modeling techniques and nearly as many use cases. These days neural networks and gradient-boosted trees are driving most of the gains.\nThe models track as many as 1,600 variables across data from millions of transactions. So Upstart can use billions of data points to test competing models.\n\u201cAt one point, these comparisons took more than a day to run on a CPU, but our research found we could cut that down by a factor of five by porting the work to GPUs,\u201d Schneider said.\nThese days, Upstart trains and evaluates new machine-learning models in a few hours instead of days.\nThe Power of Two\nLooking ahead, the company\u2019s researchers are experimenting with NVIDIA RAPIDS, libraries that quickly move data science jobs to GPUs.\nSchneider gives a glowing report of the \u201ccustomer support on steroids\u201d his team gets from solution architects at NVIDIA.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice for our research team to have experts helping us solve our problems. Having a proactive partner who understands the technology\u2019s inner workings frees us up to focus on interesting business problems and turn around model improvements that affect our end users,\u201d he said.\nEarly Innings for AI Banking\nAs a startup, the company built and tested models on GPU-powered laptops. These days it uses the cloud to handle its scaled up AI work, but Schneider sees the potential for another boomerang in the future with some work hosted on the company\u2019s own systems.\nDespite its successful IPO in December, it\u2019s still early innings for Upstart. For example, the company started offering auto loans in September.\nGoing public amid a global pandemic \u201cwas a very surreal and exciting experience an"

      "content": "Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST) was built on a simple yet revolutionary idea: What if advanced AI could assess creditworthiness better than traditional credit scores? That\u2019s the core belief driving Upstart, now a leading AI-powered lending marketplace. Since its founding in 2012, UPST has connected millions of consumers with over 100 banks and credit unions. Their platform offers a range of products, including personal loans, auto refinancing, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and small-dollar loans.\nThe company was a market darling in 2020 and 2021, thanks to low interest rates and a strong demand for consumer lending. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was up 264% year-over-year, with a net income of $135.44 million. The stock hit an all-time high of $390 in October 2021. However, as interest rates began to rise, demand for its services dropped, turning those profits into losses over the past two years.\nDespite this downturn, Upstart is leveraging its AI capabilities to stay at the forefront of fintech innovation. Its AI model analyzes 1,600 variables to provide a more nuanced view of creditworthiness, offering a competitive edge in loan approvals while managing default risks. That's a winning combination because it could translate into higher revenue and profits.\nIn recent years, Upstart has expanded its network of lending partners and ventured into new loan products. Though 2022 was challenging due to cautious investor behavior, the company\u2019s AI-driven approach remains strong, with recent loan originations reflecting solid growth.\nWhile the road ahead may be challenging, there are signs that the worst is behind Upstart. Revenue has hit a low and is beginning to climb again, and cost-cutting measures have helped stabilize losses. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a 10.9% year-over-year increase in revenue to $149.23 million, with further growth of 10.5% and 27.3% expected for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nNavigating Financial Waters With AI-Driven Precision\nBuilding on its AI-driven approach, UPST recently reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2024, revealing signs of sequential growth and a clear path toward EBITDA profitability. Central to this progress is the launch of the company's new credit pricing model, M18. This innovative model integrates the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) as a key feature, which is not typically seen in traditional risk models. By generating about 1 million predictions for each applicant (six times more than its previous model), M18 aims to fine-tune accuracy and enhance the loan approval process.\nOn the financial side, the company\u2019s revenue amounted to $127.63 million in the quarter that ended June 2024, beating analysts' estimates of $124.53 million. For the first half of 2024, its revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $255.42 million, while total fee revenue grew 3% to $268.60 million. Moreover, UPST saw a 31% increase in loan transactions, reaching about 144,000 loans and welcoming over 89,000 new borrowers.\nDuring its earnings call, management proudly shared that 91% of their core unsecured loans in Q2 were fully automated, which means no documents, phone calls, or human involvement is required. This automation rate was 73% just two years ago, and hitting 90% seemed out of reach. However, thanks to AI, they\u2019ve not only achieved it but also kept fraud at bay, solidifying Upstart\u2019s position as a leader in AI-driven lending.\nLooking ahead, the company is optimistic. It forecasts $150 million in revenue for Q3 2024 and expects to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4. Moreover, it expects a fee revenue of $320 million for the second half of the year. With its innovative AI solutions and expanding product offerings, Upstart is well-positioned for continued growth in the evolving lending landscape.\nBottom Line\nAs Upstart continues to innovate with new AI-driven models like Model 18, it's clear that the future of lending is becoming more intelligent, accessible, and tailored to individual needs. The company\u2019s efforts to integrate AI into every facet of its operations reshape the financial landscape, making credit more inclusive and efficiently managed.\nInvestors should recognize that the technology driving Upstart is more than just a trend; it\u2019s a powerful tool with the potential to reshape a trillion-dollar market. With lending being such a crucial part of the economy, Upstart\u2019s relatively modest market cap of $3.06 billion leaves room for significant growth if its technology continues to prove itself.\nDespite some bumps in the road, the company's increase in loan volume and its anticipated positive EBITDA by the fourth quarter demonstrate a resilient and forward-looking business model. Its focus on refining technology and balancing growth with responsible management positions Upstart as a leader in the AI-driven transformation of the credit industry.\nAs the market\u2019s perception shifts and conditions become more favorable, this could be a pivotal "

      "content": "Adapting to the Next Frontier in Lending:\nAI-Driven Credit Decisioning in Uncertain Times\nEconomic uncertainty has prevailed into 2024 with rising defaults and inflationary pressures. However, AI has the potential to help credit unions successfully navigate these headwinds.\nDespite high interest rates, the American consumer is increasingly turning to personal loans to help manage their rising monthly household expenses; according to Transunion, unsecured personal loan balances grew 9 percent year-over-year in Q1 2024.1 To help lend safely in this challenging environment, credit unions can harness AI to help deliver the funds consumers need in this inflationary environment while meeting higher return and lower loss targets.\nAI and machine learning (ML) enable unprecedented advancements, particularly in the realm of consumer lending. Upstart has been at the forefront of using AI to improve consumer lending for both credit unions and their members. Over ten years, Upstart has facilitated nearly $40B2 in loans for its lending partners to over 3 million3 American consumers, showcasing how AI and ML can reshape underwriting for the better.\nHow Upstart drives positive change for borrowers:\n- Better risk assessment: At the core of Upstart\u2019s mission is a desire to expand access to affordable credit by enhancing underwriting using the power of AI. By using vast datasets, Upstart\u2019s models separate risk 3-6x better than traditional methods.4 Unlike conventional approaches that rely on summarizing credit data, our sophisticated personal loan underwriting model teases out the relationships between more than 2,500 variables trained on 82 million monthly borrower repayment events5, giving credit unions improved accuracy to safely approve creditworthy borrowers.\n- Faster decisions and funding: Speed is another benefit of AI-driven lending. With loan decisions rendered in seconds and funds distributed to borrowers within the same or next day, Upstart delivers an experience akin to the experience consumers expect from their everyday providers like Amazon and Uber. This rapid service not only meets but exceeds consumer expectations, enabling lenders to set the standards for efficiency in the industry.\n- Cost savings: AI enables credit unions to offer loans at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. By automating processes and minimizing human intervention, Upstart achieves high cost efficiencies. In fact, 90 percent of Upstart-powered loans are processed without human intervention, showcasing the potential of AI to streamline operations.6\n- More inclusive decisions: Upstart's AI models also enable credit unions to lend more inclusively while employing more accurate risk assessment. Upstart approves 101 percent more applicants than traditional methods, also extending 38 percent lower APRs to qualified individuals, contributing to greater economic empowerment and bridging existing gaps to credit access.7\nCompliance excellence is the core of success\nThe integration of AI into lending, however, necessitates rigorous compliance measures to safeguard against potential biases or discriminatory outcomes. Upstart developed a Fair Lending Testing Program alongside the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) to meet the highest testing standards and ensure ethical and equitable lending practices. Each new model Upstart introduces undergoes rigorous fair lending testing before being introduced to lending partners.\nUpstart is committed to enabling its credit union partners with robust risk management protocols and helping them best prepare for regulatory examinations. Upstart has introduced the Upstart Program Certification, which includes modules that equip its lending partners to effectively explain the Upstart program and navigate regulatory examinations with confidence and competence.\nServe existing members in uncertain times\nIn today\u2019s uncertain economic landscape, credit union leaders want to focus on retaining, serving and lending to their existing members. To help credit unions retain and deepen these existing relationships, Upstart developed Recognized Customer Personalization (RCP). With RCP, Upstart can identify when an existing member of a credit union is applying for a loan on Upstart.com. For partner credit unions, Upstart can ensure that the credit union is able to provide their members a compelling offer of credit. This enables credit unions to further tailor loan offerings, strengthening relationships and fostering long-term member loyalty.\nThen, once the credit union is ready to grow its membership, it can add a configuration to the program to extend offers to new members applying at Upstart.com, using the same or modified credit criteria. From there, Upstart can help the credit union cross-sell and further cultivate these new member relationships for long-term growth.\nEmbracing a future where AI creates better lending outcomes\nAfter 8 years of partnering with over 1008 banks and credit unions alike, Ups"
