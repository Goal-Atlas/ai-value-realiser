      "content": "BuzzFeed says it\u2019s going to use AI tools provided by ChatGPT creator OpenAI to \u201cenhance\u201d and \u201cpersonalize\u201d its content, according to a memo sent this morning to staff by CEO Jonah Peretti and statements given to The Verge.\nBuzzFeed says it will use AI tools from OpenAI to personalize its content\nIt\u2019s the latest media organization to turn to automated methods to process content. But the company says its newsroom will stay focused on human work.\nIt\u2019s the latest media organization to turn to automated methods to process content. But the company says its newsroom will stay focused on human work.\nIn the memo, Peretti says AI will be one of the two major trends defining the future of digital media (the other being \u201ccreators\u201d). Peretti says that in 2023, BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cAI inspired content\u201d will launch on the site, \u201cenhancing the quiz experience, informing our brainstorming, and personalizing our content for our audience.\u201d News of the memo was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cOur industry will expand beyond AI-powered curation (feeds), to AI-powered creation (content),\u201d says Peretti. \u201cAI opens up a new era of creativity, where creative humans like us play a key role providing the ideas, cultural currency, inspired prompts, IP, and formats that come to life using the newest technologies.\u201d\nIn an example cited by the WSJ but not included in the memo, AI could be used to generate personalized rom-com pitches for readers. They would be asked a series of questions, including personal information (like \u201cname an endearing flaw\u201d and \u201cpick a favorite rom-com trope\u201d), which would be used to generate a shareable output.\nPeretti notes in the memo that he\u2019ll be sharing \u201ca preview of the content we\u2019ll be launching in February\u201d at an all hands meeting later today. (You can read the memo in full below.)\nWhen asked by The Verge if BuzzFeed was considering using AI in its newsroom, the company\u2019s VP of communications, Matt Mittenthal, replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Mitthenthal also said: \u201cI can confirm that we\u2019ll be using OpenAI technology.\u201d\nThe increasing capability of AI tools like ChatGPT to write prose has made the technology a tempting prospect for media companies hurt by falling advertising rates. BuzzFeed, in particular, has had a rocky ride on the markets since going public in December 2021. By June 2022, the company\u2019s share price had already fallen 40 percent and has continued trending downwards since. Following news this morning that BuzzFeed will be using AI to produce content, its share price had risen more than 100 percent at the time of writing.\nAlthough publishers like The Associated Press have used automated tools to produce stories for nearly a decade, these have tended to be formulaic articles covering news like earnings reports and sporting results. Automated tools are used to input figures and results into prewritten templates. As AI systems have improved, though, so has their ability to write more of a story. The problem is that the more AI is used in a story\u2019s creation, the more chance there is for mistakes to be introduced. This is especially true of tools like ChatGPT, which have a tendency to produce \u201cfluent bullshit\u201d \u2014 that is, plausible but incorrect information.\nRecently, CNET was criticized for failing to clearly disclose its use of AI in writing a number of articles offering financial advice in its money section. The company, which is owned by private equity firm Red Ventures, has since paused its use of AI tools and says it found errors in more than half of the articles written with the technology\u2019s help.\nYou can read the memo in full below:\nHi all,\nI want to share thoughts today on our strategy. As we continue to navigate through challenging times, our mission is more important than ever \u2013 to spread truth, joy, and creativity to the biggest, most diverse, most online audiences. We are fortunate to have a talented team, iconic brands, and a differentiated technology platform that allows us to stand out in a crowded market and have an unparalleled impact on culture. And, of course, the best of the Internet: lists, quizzes, and video from BuzzFeed; premium, award-winning series from Complex Networks; two of the largest food brands on the Internet in Tasty and First We Feast; and free, award-winning journalism from HuffPost and BuzzFeed News.\nIn the short term, we will fiercely focus on delivering strong value for our partners so that they continue to spend with us during the recession, and manage our costs and run our company like a lean, scrappy startup. In tough economic times, we need to fight for every penny of revenue, and try to save every penny of costs.\nBut the truth is that working hard for our partners and operating cost efficiently, while essential, will only get us so far. To fulfill the promise of our mission, we need to build a stronger business foundation by executing a forward-looking strategy. We must look ahead and shift our business towards longer term trends in order to seize the opportunities "

      "content": "BuzzFeed said Thursday that it will work with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to use artificial intelligence to help create content for its audience, marking a milestone in how media companies implement the new technology into their businesses.\nJonah Peretti, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told employees in a memo that they can expect \u201cAI inspired content\u201d to \u201cmove from an R&D stage to part of our core business.\u201d\nPeretti elaborated that the technology will be used to create quizzes, help with brainstorming, and assist in personalizing content to its audience. BuzzFeed, for now, will not use artificial intelligence to help write news stories, a spokesperson told CNN.\n\u201cTo be clear, we see the breakthroughs in AI opening up a new era of creativity that will allow humans to harness creativity in new ways with endless opportunities and applications for good,\u201d Peretti said. \u201cIn publishing, AI can benefit both content creators and audiences, inspiring new ideas and inviting audience members to co-create personalized content.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you see this work in action it is pretty amazing,\u201d Peretti added, vowing to \u201clead the future of AI-powered content.\u201d\nThe news sent BuzzFeed\u2019s sagging stock skyrocketing more than 150% in trading Thursday to more than $2 a share.\nMedia industry leaders have increasingly said that artificial intelligence will revolutionize their businesses.\nWhile BuzzFeed is the biggest digital content creator to move to implement OpenAI\u2019s technology into its business, some other outlets have taken similar steps.\nCNET recently used an artificial intelligence tool to help write stories. But the process did not go smoothly, with a number of articles ultimately requiring corrections.\nIn a note published online Wednesday, CNET Editor-In-Chief Connie Guglielmo apologized for the errors and said new processes had been put in place to prevent them in the future.\nBut, Guglielmo said, the outlet will not shy away from using artificial intelligence moving forward.\n\u201cThe process may not always be easy or pretty, but we\u2019re going to continue embracing it \u2013 and any new tech that we believe makes life better,\u201d Guglielmo wrote.\nThe Associated Press also began using artificial intelligence to automate news stories nearly a decade ago."

      "content": "AI content on Buzzfeed often sees above-average engagement and time spent compared to posts created entirely by humans or less interactive pages, the publisher has said.\nThe AI formats are proving useful in meeting the publisher\u2019s aim to drive more direct traffic to Buzzfeed properties, as major tech platforms like Facebook are sending less traffic back to digital publishers. This marks a major shift from its previous successes and reliance on going viral across social media, although the company says it still does this too.\nBuzzfeed chief executive and founder Jonah Peretti told investors this week: \u201cWe have prioritised resources aimed at growing engagement on our owned-and-operated properties through new AI-powered content formats.\n\u201cIn doing so, we are reducing our dependence on the major tech platforms and leaning into our rare combination of voice and scale in a fragmented media environment.\u201d\nPeretti also said changes to the major platforms \u201ccontinue to impact audience traffic to our content\u201d so they are \u201claser-focused on our strategy to drive traffic directly\u201d.\nBuzzfeed doubled its output of AI-assisted content between Q1 and Q2 and expects to continue ramping up at a similar rate in Q3, Peretti said. The media\u2019s experimentation with generative AI mostly began this year following ChatGPT\u2019s November launch.\nPeretti also put AI at the centre of Buzzfeed\u2019s brand identity, describing it as \u201cpop culture, entertainment and curating the best of the internet using AI to shift content delivery and distribution\u201d.\nBuzzfeed\u2019s experiments with AI so far have focused on adding \u201cpersonalisation, customisation and interactivity\u201d to its content, as Peretti explained in the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday for the three months ending on 30 June.\nAlthough Buzzfeed quizzes were already interactive, they are now \u201cinfinitely interactive\u201d, Peretti said. Buzzfeed\u2019s AI-driven quizzes, which launched in February, are dubbed \u2018Infinity Quizzes\u2019.\nThe brand then expanded into chatbot games, such as one that allows users to see if they could make it as an influencer without getting cancelled, and a guessing game where the chatbot invites users to guess which fictional character it is that day.\nPeretti said users \u201creally loved\u201d these formats and that they \u201cspend two, three more times interacting with a chatbot game than with a static piece of content\u201d.\nFinally, Buzzfeed has begun using \u201cAI-assisted imagery\u201d. For example, a piece that used Midjourney to imagine what Barbie\u2019s dreamhouse would look like in each US state saw more than one million views and, according to Peretti, went viral on Tiktok and Instagram Reels.\nThat story contains a footnote stating \u201cThis post was enhanced using AI-powered creativity tools\u201d, while the pictures are all credited to Midjourney and the author. Peretti said these tools allowed the publisher \u201cto participate in big cultural moments\u201d like the release of the Barbie movie in July.\n\u201cThose are examples of new things we can do to enhance our product, make our product more vibrant, more personal, and have really worked well with our audience,\u201d he said.\n\u2018We still have to build out for scale\u2019\nPeretti said the new AI formats are proving \u201cdeeply engaging\u201d, saying: \u201cWhen we look at individual pieces of AI content, we see increased engagement, more time spent, and AI-inspired image posts that have gone viral across Buzzfeed.com, Instagram and Tiktok.\u201d\nHe added that views and time spent with Buzzfeed\u2019s AI content both increased three-fold between Q1 and Q2 \u201cdriven by higher content output, and the new content is also driving higher engagement quarter-over-quarter.\n\u201cOur top 20 AI articles published in Q2 generated more than twice the time spent when compared with our top 20 AI articles in Q1.\u201d\nThis will prove useful as, overall, Buzzfeed\u2019s results showed time spent across its properties fell by 9% year-on-year in the second quarter to 96 million hours. This figure includes Buzzfeed\u2019s owned and operated platforms (including Huffpost) as well as Youtube and Apple News but excludes platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat and Twitter, which the publisher says now offer minimal advertising capabilities.\nPeretti added: \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty early and I feel like we\u2019ve figured out how to bake some good cakes, but we still have to build out the bakery that can scale this and make more content experiences like this widely distributed across our network.\u201d\nBuzzfeed AI content creation \u2018more efficient and more scalable\u2019\nThe AI content is also keeping clients happy, Buzzfeed told investors. On the earnings call, Buzzfeed president Marcela Martin said that two infinity quizzes made in partnership with mattress brand Serta \u2013 a bedtime story generator and a dream interpreter \u2013 saw \u201cabove average time spent compared to non-AI formats, and audience clickthrough rate and engagement rate both exceeded the client\u2019s expectations\u201d.\nContent revenues, which come from client deals involving the likes of branded quizzes, Instagram "
