What did that entail? New buildings, a massive recruitment drive, a new fleet of refrigerated vehicles, and a website and app built on Salling Group's existing technology stack.\nAnd to meet urgent needs, the company massively condensed the project\u2019s timeline, becoming a lifeline to millions of families and ushering in a new age of digital growth.\nSalling Group introduced a delivery service for its F\u00f8tex brand in Copenhagen, at the pace of pandemic-inspired change. Accenture helped with UX design, journey mapping, and a front-end build for digital touchpoints to create a \u201cminimal lovable product\u201d that would recreate the comforts of the in-person grocery shopping experience, coupled with unparalleled convenience.\nThe website and app went beyond basics to offer user-friendly shopping lists and a recipe curation option capable of suggesting ingredient swaps for carbon offset. Accenture\u2019s experts were involved in the end-to-end delivery of the service, guiding a sound operational approach focused on customer experience.\nSalling Group debuted its new business in just 10 months, and pandemic-era customers eagerly embraced the new service. Throughout the build, the Accenture team focused on a design and front-end experience that would delight and satisfy customers, drawing on extensive experience with global food brands and technology.\nSalling Group\u2019s customer-centric digital shopping experience now brings everything shoppers love about F\u00f8tex straight to the front porch."
