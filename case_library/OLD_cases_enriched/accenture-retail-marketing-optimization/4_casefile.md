# Case File: Accenture's Retail Marketing Optimization

## Executive Summary

Accenture's case study on retail marketing optimization presents general industry insights about AI adoption and data-driven business practices, along with a specific digital transformation project for Salling Group. The materials primarily contain market research statistics about AI adoption rates and executive sentiment rather than detailed functional optimization outcomes.

The most substantive example involves Salling Group's rapid deployment of a digital grocery delivery service during the pandemic, completed in 10 months. However, this appears to represent new business model creation rather than optimization of existing marketing functions, suggesting potential misclassification of the case tier.

## Detailed Findings

**C1 - Data-Driven Revenue Growth (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Data-driven companies achieve 10-15% more revenue growth than their peers
- **Evidence**: "10-15% more revenue growth is achieved by data-driven companies than by their peers"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Generic industry statistic about data-driven companies, not specific functional optimization
- **Recommendation**: This is general market research rather than a specific capability case and should be omitted

**C2 - Executive AI Sentiment (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: 97% of executives believe generative AI will transform their company and industry
- **Evidence**: "97% of executives said generative AI will transform their company and industry"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Executive sentiment survey, not functional optimization or capability improvement
- **Recommendation**: Survey data about AI beliefs doesn't constitute a capability case and should be omitted

**C3 - AI Scaling Challenges (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Only 9% of companies have successfully scaled AI due to deployment challenges
- **Evidence**: "Only 9% of companies have fully deployed an AI use case due to scaling challenges"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Industry deployment statistics, not specific functional optimization
- **Recommendation**: Market research about AI scaling challenges should be omitted as it doesn't describe specific improvements

**C4 - AI Investment Gap (REJECTED)**
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Claim**: Despite recognizing AI's transformative potential, only 31% of companies have made significant investments
- **Evidence**: "97% of companies know gen AI is transformative but only 31% have invested significantly"
- **Source**: S1
- **Issue**: Investment sentiment data, not functional optimization
- **Recommendation**: Investment survey data doesn't describe specific capability improvements and should be omitted

**C5 - Digital Business Launch Timeline (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: Salling Group successfully launched a new digital delivery business in just 10 months during the pandemic
- **Evidence**: "Salling Group debuted its new business in just 10 months, and pandemic-era customers eagerly embraced the new service"
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: This appears to describe new business creation rather than optimization of existing functions
- **Recommendation**: May be misclassified - launching a new digital delivery business sounds more like tier 1 (business model innovation) than Tier 1 (functional optimization)

**C6 - Customer Experience Transformation (NEEDS_REVIEW)**
- **Status**: NEEDS_REVIEW
- **Claim**: The digital transformation created a customer-centric shopping experience that delivers the Føtex brand experience directly to customers
- **Evidence**: "Salling Group's customer-centric digital shopping experience now brings everything shoppers love about Føtex straight to the front porch"
- **Source**: S3
- **Issue**: Lacks specificity about what was optimized or improved, may be more about brand experience than functional optimization
- **Recommendation**: Need more specific details about functional improvements or metrics to qualify as capability optimization
