# Baptist Care - Copilot Saves Employees Time to Focus More on Patient Care

## Executive Summary

This case file documents Baptist Care's reported use of Microsoft Copilot to save employee time and enable greater focus on patient care. However, the investigation is currently incomplete due to source access limitations. The primary source document could not be retrieved due to access restrictions (403 Forbidden error), preventing verification of the claimed benefits and implementation details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Primary source inaccessible due to technical restrictions
- No verifiable claims or specific metrics available
- Case requires additional source material for proper validation

## Detailed Findings

### Source Access Issues

The investigation encountered significant limitations in accessing the primary source material. The Microsoft Cloud Blog post that allegedly contains Baptist Care's success story returned a 403 Forbidden error, indicating either:
- Content access restrictions
- Potential URL issues or content removal
- Authentication requirements not met

### Missing Claims Analysis

Due to the source access failure, no specific claims about Baptist Care's Copilot implementation could be extracted or verified. This includes:
- Time savings metrics
- Employee productivity improvements
- Patient care impact measurements
- Implementation scope and scale
- ROI or cost-benefit analysis

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Alternative Source Discovery**: Seek additional sources documenting Baptist Care's Copilot implementation
2. **Direct Outreach**: Consider contacting Baptist Care directly for case study information
3. **Microsoft Partnership Verification**: Verify through Microsoft's official customer success channels
4. **Healthcare Industry Reports**: Search for third-party coverage of this implementation
