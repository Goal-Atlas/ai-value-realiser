# UHCW NHS Trust AI Patient Flow Optimization Case File

## Executive Summary

University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust has implemented multiple digital solutions to optimize patient flow and enhance patient experience. The Trust partnered with IBM Consulting and AWS to pilot AI-powered patient engagement tools, including a virtual assistant, automated messaging systems, and digital preparation platforms. While several operational improvements are well-documented, some claims about patient outcome improvements require additional verification.

**Key Verified Outcomes:**
- Virtual assistant successfully reduces operational workload by handling FAQs and routing complex queries
- Digital solutions demonstrably free up staff time through automation
- Cost-effective alternatives to traditional face-to-face patient preparation methods
- Easily adoptable digital solutions that enhance patient experience

**Areas Requiring Further Evidence:**
- Quantified improvements in patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes
- Specific evidence of anxiety reduction through digital preparation
- Measurable financial impact reductions from digital interventions

## Detailed Findings

### **APPROVED CLAIMS**

#### C1: Virtual Assistant Operational Impact ✅
**Claim:** Virtual assistant reduces operational workload by handling frequently asked questions and appointment queries before escalating to live agents

**Evidence:** "By using self-service and intelligent routing, the VA aims to reduce the total number of calls that the Patient Access Team needs to handle, reducing operational time and costs."

**Assessment:** Well-supported claim with clear mechanism explanation. The virtual assistant powered by Amazon Lex provides automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding to handle routine inquiries before escalating complex cases.

#### C2: Staff Time Liberation ✅
**Claim:** Digital solutions free up staff time by automating patient interactions

**Evidence:** "IBM Consulting and AWS provided investment and technology for UHCW NHS Trust to pilot new solutions focused on digitizing patient interactions to improve their experience and free-up staff time."

**Assessment:** Directly supported by source material describing the explicit objective of the digital transformation initiative.

#### C5: Automated Query Resolution ✅
**Claim:** Automated email responder resolves patient queries more quickly by requesting missing information

**Evidence:** "An automated email responder using Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to ask patients to provide missing information so their queries can be resolved more quickly."

**Assessment:** Specific functionality clearly described with direct mechanism for improvement.

#### C9: Cost-Effective Digital Preparation ✅
**Claim:** Digital app provides cost-effective psychological preparation compared to traditional face-to-face meetings

**Evidence:** "Currently, this is predominantly provided via paper leaflets and a single face to face meeting pre-admission; it is thus limited by cost and time."

**Assessment:** Supported by description of current limitations, implying digital alternatives offer cost and time advantages.

#### C10: Easy Implementation ✅
**Claim:** Digital solution provides easily adoptable enhancement to patient experience

**Evidence:** "The Little Journey App has provided an easily adoptable solution to enhance the patient experience for children and their parents when they are visiting hospital for a planned procedure."

**Assessment:** Direct quote from clinical staff confirming ease of adoption and patient experience enhancement.

### **CLAIMS NEEDING REVIEW**

#### C3: Patient Satisfaction and Clinical Outcomes ⚠️
**Claim:** Automated systems improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes through easier appointment management

**Current Evidence:** "This makes it easier for a specific subset of patients to receive reminders and reschedule appointments – further improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes."

**Gap:** Quote describes system capabilities but lacks empirical evidence of actual satisfaction or outcome improvements. Requires patient satisfaction metrics or clinical outcome data.

#### C4: Industry-Wide Staff Focus Benefits ⚠️
**Claim:** Digital self-service platforms enable staff to focus on more complex queries

**Current Evidence:** "Most industries have moved to digital self-service platforms that make life easier for users and improve their satisfaction with services, whilst enabling staff to focus on more complex queries."

**Gap:** General industry statement not specific to UHCW implementation. Needs UHCW-specific evidence of staff reallocation to complex tasks.

#### C6: Digital Anxiety Reduction ⚠️
**Claim:** Digital preparation reduces pre-operative anxiety in children, with 50-75% of children affected by such anxiety

**Current Evidence:** "Pre-operative anxiety affects 50-75% of children and is associated with worse physical and mental outcomes for the patient."

**Gap:** Quote provides anxiety prevalence statistics but doesn't demonstrate that digital preparation reduces anxiety. Requires before/after anxiety measurements.

#### C7: Behavioral Change Prevention ⚠️
**Claim:** Digital psychological preparation prevents negative post-hospital behavioral changes that affect 50% of children

**Current Evidence:** "Fifty percent of children develop negative post-hospital behavioural changes, such as separation anxiety and bed-wetting; 8% of these changes are on-going at one year post-procedure."

**Gap:** Statistics on behavioral changes provided but no evidence that digital preparation prevents them. Needs comparative outcome data.

#### C8: Financial Impact Reduction ⚠️
**Claim:** Digital preparation reduces financial implications from cancelled operations and ongoing medical costs

**Current Evidence:** "Additionally, there are financial implications for the hospital and wider society, for example due to cancelled operations or ongoing medical costs due to treatment non-adherence."

**Gap:** Identifies financial implications exist but doesn't demonstrate digital solutions reduce them. Requires cost-benefit analysis or operational metrics.
